              " 'answer': \"Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant for several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Transparency**: It ensures that individuals are informed when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect them. This transparency helps build trust between the public and the entities using these systems.\\n\\n2. **Accountability**: By requiring organizations to explain how decisions are made, it holds them accountable for the outcomes of their automated systems. This means that if a decision negatively impacts someone, they have the right to understand the reasoning behind it and contest it if necessary.\\n\\n3. **Empowerment**: Notice and explanation empower individuals by giving them the information they need to understand their rights and the processes that affect their lives. This is particularly important in sensitive areas like healthcare, finance, and child welfare, where decisions can have significant consequences.\\n\\n4. **Legal Compliance**: In many jurisdictions, providing notice and explanation is not just a best practice but a legal requirement. Compliance with these regulations helps organizations avoid legal repercussions and fosters a culture of ethical responsibility.\\n\\n5. **Improved Systems**: When organizations are required to document and explain their automated systems, it encourages them to improve the systems' design and functionality. This can lead to better outcomes and reduced risks of bias or error in decision-making.\\n\\nOverall, these requirements are essential for ensuring that automated systems are used in a way that respects individuals' rights and promotes fairness and justice in society (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).\",\n",
              " 'contexts': ['Providing notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them.',\n",

              " 'answer': 'Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant for several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Transparency**: It ensures that individuals are aware when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect their lives. This transparency helps build trust between the public and the entities deploying these systems.\\n\\n2. **Accountability**: By requiring entities to identify themselves and explain their systems, it holds them accountable for the decisions made by these automated systems. This accountability is crucial for addressing any potential biases or errors in the algorithms.\\n\\n3. **Empowerment**: When individuals receive clear explanations about how decisions are made, they are better equipped to contest or appeal those decisions if they believe they have been treated unfairly. This empowerment is particularly important in sensitive areas like credit, employment, and legal proceedings.\\n\\n4. **Safety and Efficacy**: Clear notice and explanations allow experts and stakeholders to verify the reasonableness of automated recommendations before they are enacted. This can help prevent harmful outcomes and ensure that the systems are functioning as intended.\\n\\n5. **Public Awareness**: The requirement helps the public understand the implications of automated systems on their rights and opportunities. This knowledge is essential for fostering informed discussions about the ethical use of AI and its impact on society.\\n\\nOverall, these requirements aim to mitigate the risks associated with the opaque nature of automated decision-making processes and ensure that individuals are treated fairly and justly (Source: [document name], p.

Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \\nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access.

But this expansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a hiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\\n-\\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting decisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. Notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\\n-\\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \\nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. Clear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\\n-\\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a particular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, unaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement.'],\n",

              " 'answer': \"Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant for several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Transparency**: It ensures that individuals are aware when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect their lives, such as in hiring, credit scoring, or legal judgments. This transparency helps build trust in these systems (Source: [document name], p. 6).\\n\\n2. **Accountability**: By requiring organizations to explain how decisions are made, it holds them accountable for the outcomes of their automated systems. This means that if a decision negatively impacts someone, they have the right to understand the reasoning behind it and contest it if necessary (Source: [document name], p. 6).\\n\\n3. **Empowerment**: Notice and explanation empower individuals by giving them the information they need to understand and potentially challenge decisions made by automated systems. This is crucial in ensuring that people can address any errors or biases that may arise from these systems (Source: [document name], p. 6).\\n\\n4. **Safety and Efficacy**: Clear explanations allow experts to verify the reasonableness of automated recommendations before they are enacted, which is essential for ensuring that these systems operate safely and effectively (Source: [document name], p. 6).\\n\\n5. **Legal Compliance**: In some sectors, providing notice and explanation is already a legal requirement. Extending this practice across various sectors helps ensure consistent protection of individuals' rights and opportunities (Source: [document name], p. 6).\\n\\nOverall, these requirements are designed to protect individuals from potential harms associated with automated decision-making and to foster a more equitable and just use of technology in society.\",\n",
              " 'contexts': ['NOTICE & \\nEXPLANATION \\nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \\nagainst, including illustrative examples. \\nAutomated systems now determine opportunities, from employment to credit, and directly shape the American \\npublic’s experiences, from the courtroom to online classrooms, in ways that profoundly impact people’s lives. But this expansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a hiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\\n-\\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting decisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. Notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\\n-\\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \\nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. Clear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\\n-\\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a particular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, unaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement. \\nProviding notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \\nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access.

An assessment should be done to determine the level of risk of the auto -\\nmated system. In settings where the consequences are high as determined by a risk assessment, or extensive \\noversight is expected (e.g., in criminal justice or some public sector settings), explanatory mechanisms should be built into the system design so that the system’s full behavior can be explained in advance (i.e., only fully transparent models should be used), rather than as an after-the-decision interpretation. In other settings, the extent of explanation provided should be tailored to the risk level. \\nValid. The explanation provided by a system should accurately reflect the factors and the influences that led \\nto a particular decision, and should be meaningful for the particular customization based on purpose, target, and level of risk. While approximation and simplification may be necessary for the system to succeed based on the explanatory purpose and target of the explanation, or to account for the risk of fraud or other concerns related to revealing decision-making information, such simplifications should be done in a scientifically supportable way. Where appropriate based on the explanatory system, error ranges for the explanation should be calculated and included in the explanation, with the choice of presentation of such information balanced with usability and overall interface complexity concerns. \\nDemonstrate protections for notice and explanation \\nReporting. Summary reporting should document the determinations made based on the above consider -\\nations, including: the responsible entities for accountability purposes; the goal and use cases for the system, identified users, and impacted populations; the assessment of notice clarity and timeliness; the assessment of the explanation's validity and accessibility; the assessment of the level of risk; and the account and assessment of how explanations are tailored, including to the purpose, the recipient of the explanation, and the level of risk. Individualized profile information should be made readily available to the greatest extent possible that includes explanations for any system impacts or inferences.

              " 'answer': \"Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant for several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Transparency**: It ensures that individuals are aware when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect them. This transparency helps build trust between the public and the entities deploying these systems.\\n\\n2. **Accountability**: By requiring entities to identify themselves and explain their systems, it holds them accountable for the decisions made by these automated systems. This means that if a decision negatively impacts someone, they can seek clarification and potentially contest that decision.\\n\\n3. **Empowerment**: When individuals receive clear explanations about how decisions are made, they are better equipped to understand and challenge those decisions if necessary. This is particularly important in sensitive areas like healthcare, child welfare, and credit assessments, where decisions can significantly impact people's lives.\\n\\n4. **Fairness**: Notice and explanation requirements can help mitigate biases in automated decision-making. By ensuring that individuals understand the criteria and data used in these systems, it becomes easier to identify and address any discriminatory practices.\\n\\n5. **Informed Consent**: Individuals have the right to know how their data is being used and how it affects them. Providing notice and explanations supports informed consent, allowing people to make better decisions regarding their engagement with automated systems.\\n\\nOverall, these requirements aim to create a more equitable and just environment where automated systems are used responsibly and ethically (Source: [document name], p.

In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \\nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access.
