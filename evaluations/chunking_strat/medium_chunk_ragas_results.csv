What is the significance of providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems?,"[""Providing notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the validity and reasonable use of automated systems. \n• A lawyer representing an older client with disabilities who had been cut off from Medicaid-funded home\nhealth-care assistance couldn't determine why\n, especially since the decision went against historical access\npractices. In a court hearing, the lawyer learned from a witness that the state in which the older client\nlived \nhad recently adopted a new algorithm to determine eligibility.83 The lack of a timely explanation made it\nharder \nto understand and contest the decision.\n•\nA formal child welfare investigation is opened against a parent based on an algorithm and without the parent\never \nbeing notified that data was being collected and used as part of an algorithmic child maltreatment\nrisk assessment.84 The lack of notice or an explanation makes it harder for those performing child\nmaltreatment assessments to validate the risk assessment and denies parents knowledge that could help them\ncontest a decision.\n41""

 'NOTICE & \nEXPLANATION \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nAn automated system should provide demonstrably clear, timely, understandable, and accessible notice of use, and \nexplanations as to how and why a decision was made or an action was taken by the system. These expectations are explained below. \nProvide clear, timely, understandable, and accessible notice of use and explanations \nGenerally accessible plain language documentation. The entity responsible for using the automated \nsystem should ensure that documentation describing the overall system (including any human components) is \npublic and easy to find. The documentation should describe, in plain language, how the system works and how \nany automated component is used to determine an action or decision. It should also include expectations about \nreporting described throughout this framework, such as the algorithmic impact assessments described as \npart of Algorithmic Discrimination Protections. \nAccount able.

Notice should be kept up-to-date and people impacted by the system should be notified of use case \nor key functionality changes. \nBrief and clear. Notices and explanations should be assessed, such as by research on users’ experiences, \nincluding user testing, to ensure that the people using or impacted by the automated system are able to easily'
 'NOTICE & \nEXPLANATION \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nAutomated systems now determine opportunities, from employment to credit, and directly shape the American \npublic’s experiences, from the courtroom to online classrooms, in ways that profoundly impact people’s lives. But this expansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a hiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\n-\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting decisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. Notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\n-\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. Clear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\n-\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a particular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, unaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement.']","Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant for several reasons:

1. **Transparency**: It ensures that individuals are aware when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect their lives. This transparency helps build trust between the public and the entities deploying these systems.

2. **Accountability**: By requiring entities to identify themselves and explain their systems, it holds them accountable for the decisions made by these automated systems. This accountability is crucial for addressing any potential biases or errors in the algorithms.

3. **Empowerment**: When individuals receive clear explanations about how decisions are made, they are better equipped to contest or appeal those decisions if they believe they have been treated unfairly. This empowerment is particularly important in sensitive areas like credit, employment, and legal proceedings.

4. **Safety and Efficacy**: Clear notice and explanations allow experts and stakeholders to verify the reasonableness of automated recommendations before they are enacted. This can help prevent harmful outcomes and ensure that the systems are functioning as intended.

5. **Public Awareness**: The requirement helps the public understand the implications of automated systems on their rights and opportunities. This knowledge is essential for fostering informed discussions about the ethical use of AI and its impact on society.

Overall, these requirements aim to mitigate the risks associated with the opaque nature of automated decision-making processes and ensure that individuals are treated fairly and justly (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).","Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant because it allows individuals to understand how automated systems are impacting their lives.

1. **Identifying Risks**: GAI red-teaming involves simulating potential adverse behaviors or outcomes of a GAI model in a controlled environment. This helps organizations identify risks that may not be apparent during standard testing, allowing for proactive risk management (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Stress Testing Safeguards**: By conducting red-teaming exercises, organizations can stress test the safeguards and controls they have in place. This process helps ensure that the GAI systems can withstand various scenarios and that the protective measures are effective (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Diverse Perspectives**: Engaging both expert and non-expert participants in red-teaming can provide a broader range of insights. This diversity can help uncover different types of harms and vulnerabilities that might be overlooked by a homogenous group (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Calibration of Measurement Methods**: Structured feedback from red-teaming can be used to evaluate whether GAI systems are performing as intended. This feedback can help calibrate and verify traditional measurement methods, ensuring that they accurately reflect the system's performance in real-world conditions (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Enhancing Public Trust**: By demonstrating a commitment to rigorous testing and risk management through red-teaming, organizations can enhance public trust in their GAI systems. Transparency in how risks are assessed and managed can reassure stakeholders about the safety and reliability of these technologies (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

Overall, structured human feedback exercises like GAI red-teaming are essential for improving the robustness and accountability of GAI systems, ultimately leading to better risk management practices.","Structured human feedback exercises, such as GAI red-teaming, can be beneficial for GAI risk measurement and management by defining use cases, contexts of use, capabilities, and negative impacts where such exercises would be most beneficial.

1. **Inaccurate Performance Evaluation**: Laboratory tests often use controlled conditions that may not accurately reflect the complexities and variabilities of real-world environments. As a result, GAI systems might perform well in a lab but fail to deliver the same results when deployed in diverse, unpredictable settings (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Limited Contextual Understanding**: Current testing approaches may not account for the specific contexts in which GAI systems will be used. This mismatch can lead to a lack of understanding about how the system will interact with real-world variables, such as user behavior, cultural differences, and environmental factors (Source: [document name], p.

Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or applications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based on system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation should be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should be reconsidered based on this feedback. \nTesting. Systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment. This testing should follow domain-specific best practices, when available, for ensuring the technology will work in its real-world context. Such testing should take into account both the specific technology used and the roles of any human operators or reviewers who impact system outcomes or effectiveness; testing should include both automated systems testing and human-led (manual) testing. Testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the conditions in which the system will be deployed, and new testing may be required for each deployment to account for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another. Following testing, system performance should be compared with the in-place, potentially human-driven, status quo procedures, with existing human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre-deployment, and as a lifecycle minimum performance standard.

This involves understanding what the system is intended to achieve and ensuring that data collection aligns strictly with these goals. The goals should be narrow and well-defined to avoid broadening the scope unnecessarily (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Conduct a Necessity Assessment**: Before collecting data, assess whether the data is strictly necessary for achieving the identified goals. This means evaluating whether the intended outcomes can be met without collecting additional data that may lead to mission creep (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Implement Data Minimization Principles**: Adopt data minimization practices by collecting only the data that is essential for the specific use case. This helps limit the amount of data gathered and reduces the risk of using it for unintended purposes (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Establish Clear Use-Case Boundaries**: Document and communicate the specific contexts in which the collected data will be used. This includes setting clear boundaries around how the data can be utilized and ensuring that it is not repurposed for different objectives without a thorough reassessment of privacy risks (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Set Data Retention Timelines**: Define and document clear timelines for data retention. Data should be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the identified goals, in accordance with legal or policy-based limitations. This helps prevent the accumulation of data that could be misused in the future (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Regularly Review and Update Policies**: Continuously monitor and review data collection practices and use-case boundaries to ensure they remain aligned with the original goals. This includes reassessing the necessity of data collection and making adjustments as needed to prevent mission creep (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve relevant stakeholders, including privacy experts and affected communities, in the process of defining data collection limits and use-case scopes.

1. **Risk Assessment**: Begin with a thorough risk assessment to identify the potential consequences of the automated system's decisions. This assessment should determine the level of risk associated with the system's use in specific contexts, such as criminal justice or healthcare, where the stakes are particularly high (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Use of Fully Transparent Models**: Design the system using fully transparent models that allow stakeholders to understand how decisions are made. This means employing algorithms and models that can be easily interpreted and explained, rather than relying on ""black box"" approaches that obscure the decision-making process (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Built-in Explanatory Features**: Incorporate built-in explanatory features that provide clear and accessible explanations of the system's behavior. These features should articulate the factors and influences that led to specific decisions, ensuring that users can comprehend the rationale behind outcomes (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **User-Centric Design**: Ensure that the explanations are tailored to the needs of the end-users. This involves considering the target audience's level of expertise and providing explanations that are meaningful and relevant to their context. Simplifying complex information can enhance understanding (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Error Range and Uncertainty Reporting**: Include information about error ranges and uncertainties in the explanations provided by the system. This helps users understand the limitations of the system's predictions and decisions, fostering a more realistic view of its capabilities (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Continuous Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish mechanisms for continuous feedback from users and stakeholders. This feedback can be used to refine the explanatory features and ensure that they remain effective and relevant over time (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Documentation and Reporting**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the system's design, decision-making processes, and the explanations provided. Regular reporting on the system's performance and the effectiveness of its explanatory mechanisms can enhance accountability and transparency (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

By integrating these explanatory mechanisms into the design of automated systems, organizations can enhance transparency and accountability, particularly in high-risk environments where the implications of decisions can significantly impact individuals and communities.","In settings where the consequences are high as determined by a risk assessment, or extensive oversight is expected (e.g., in criminal justice or some public sector settings), explanatory mechanisms should be built into the system design so that the system’s full behavior can be explained in advance (i.e., only fully transparent models should be used), rather than as an after-the-decision interpretation.",0.96,0.9396665493047728,1.0,0.9999999999666667,0.7138030653395179

Organizations’ use of GAI systems may also \nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.']","Organizations need to consider several risks associated with Generative AI (GAI) during the development and deployment of AI systems. Here are some key examples:

1. **Algorithmic Monocultures**: This risk arises when multiple organizations rely on the same GAI models for decision-making. Such reliance can lead to correlated failures, where a single flaw in the model affects many systems simultaneously, increasing vulnerability to unexpected shocks (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Data Poisoning**: Adversaries may manipulate the training datasets used by GAI models, leading to compromised outputs or behaviors. This can result in the generation of biased or harmful content, undermining the integrity of the AI system (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Prompt Injection Attacks**: These attacks involve modifying the input provided to a GAI system to elicit unintended behaviors. Direct prompt injections occur when attackers craft malicious prompts, while indirect injections exploit vulnerabilities in applications that integrate GAI, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Intellectual Property Risks**: GAI systems may inadvertently generate outputs that resemble copyrighted material, raising concerns about copyright infringement. The legal status of such outputs is still under debate, which can create uncertainty for organizations using GAI (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Bias and Fairness Issues**: GAI systems can perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases present in the training data. If not properly managed, these biases can lead to unfair treatment of individuals or groups, particularly in sensitive applications like hiring or lending (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Privacy Concerns**: The use of personal data in training GAI models can lead to privacy violations, especially if the data is not adequately anonymized. This risk is heightened when sensitive information is involved, such as health or location data (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Operational Risks**: GAI systems may behave unpredictably in real-world settings, leading to operational failures. This unpredictability can stem from differences between laboratory testing conditions and actual deployment environments, resulting in performance gaps (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

By being aware of these risks, organizations can implement appropriate governance, oversight, and risk management strategies to mitigate potential negative impacts associated with GAI systems.","Organizations need to consider various GAI risks in the development and deployment of AI systems, including unacceptable use identified by stakeholder communities, harmful bias and homogenization, dangerous, violent, or hateful content, immature safety or risk cultures related to AI and GAI design, development, and deployment, public information integrity risks impacting democratic processes, unknown long-term performance characteristics of GAI, and risks related to generating illegal content or violating laws.",1.0,0.9493978201836971,0.25,0.999999999975,0.9181426809466123

 ""Providing notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access.

2. **Scientific Support for Simplifications**: While simplifications may be necessary for clarity, they should be grounded in scientifically supportable methods. This ensures that any approximations do not mislead users about the system's capabilities or the reliability of its outputs (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Error Range Reporting**: Including error ranges in the explanations can help users understand the potential variability in the system's outputs. This transparency about uncertainty allows users to make more informed decisions based on the provided information (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **User-Centric Design**: Tailor explanations to the needs and understanding of the target audience.

5. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback**: Establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring of the system's performance and the effectiveness of its explanations. Regular feedback from users can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that explanations remain relevant and valid over time (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Documentation and Transparency**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the system's design, decision-making processes, and the rationale behind the explanations provided.

 '6 2.2. Confabulation  \n“Confabulation” refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and conﬁdently present \nerroneous or false content in response to prompts . Confabulations also include generated outputs that \ndiverge from the prompts  or other  input  or that contradict previously generated statements in the same \ncontext. Th ese phenomena are colloquially also referred to as “hallucination s” or “fabrication s.” \nConfabulations can occur across GAI outputs  and contexts .9,10 Confabulations are a natural result of the \nway generative models  are designed : they  generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution \nof their training data ; for example,  LLMs  predict the next  token or word  in a sentence or phrase . While \nsuch statistical  prediction can produce factual ly accurate  and consistent  outputs , it can  also produce \noutputs that are factually inaccurat e or internally inconsistent . This dynamic is particularly relevant when \nit comes to  open -ended prompts  for long- form responses  and in domains  which require highly \ncontextual and/or  domain expertise.  \nRisks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content  – often  due to the conﬁdent nature \nof the response  – leading users to act upon or promote the false information.  This poses a challenge  for \nmany real -world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient \ninformation reports could  cause doctors to make  incorrect diagnoses  and/or recommend the wrong \ntreatments.  Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor  when integrating GAI \ninto applications involving  consequential  decision making. \nGAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations  that purport to justify or explain the \nsystem’s answer , which may further mislead  humans into inappropriately trusting the system’s output. \nFor instance, LLMs  sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the'
 'the-art LLMs at the time these studies were conducted do not substantially  increase the operational \nlikelihood of such an attack.  The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or \nbiological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and \ninfrastructure . The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on  what the  key \nbarriers  for malicious actors  are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier ), and how well GAI \ncan help actors  address those barriers .  \nFurthermore , chemical and biological design tools  (BDTs)  – highly specialized AI systems  trained on \nscientiﬁc data that aid in chemical and biological design – may augment  design capabilities in chemistry \nand biology beyond what text -based LLMs are able to provide . As these models become more \neﬃcacious , including for beneﬁcial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for \nharm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents .  \nWhile some of these described capabilities  lie beyond the reach  of existing GAI tools, ongoing \nassessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both  the ability of  AI tools  to facilitate CBRN \nweapons planning and GAI systems’  connection or access to relevant data and tools . \nTrustworthy AI Characteristic : Safe , Explainable and Interpretable']","Generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), produce outputs that may result in confabulations due to the way they are designed and trained. Here are some key points explaining this phenomenon:

1. **Statistical Prediction**: LLMs generate text by predicting the next word or token based on the statistical patterns learned from their training data. This means they do not have an understanding of the content in the same way humans do; instead, they rely on patterns and associations found in the data (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Lack of Factual Verification**: When generating responses, LLMs do not verify the factual accuracy of the information they produce. They may confidently present incorrect or misleading information as if it were true, leading to outputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Open-Ended Prompts**: LLMs are particularly prone to confabulation when responding to open-ended prompts. In these cases, the model may generate long-form responses that deviate from the original context or contradict earlier statements, resulting in outputs that can be misleading (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Hallucinations**: The term ""hallucination"" is often used to describe instances where LLMs generate content that is entirely fabricated or nonsensical. This can occur when the model attempts to fill gaps in its training data or when it encounters prompts that lead it to generate creative but inaccurate responses (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Confabulated Logic and Citations**: LLMs may also produce confabulated logic or citations, where they provide seemingly logical explanations or references that do not actually exist. This can mislead users into believing that the information is credible and well-supported (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Contextual Limitations**: The ability of LLMs to maintain context over long interactions is limited. As conversations progress, the model may lose track of earlier details, leading to inconsistencies in its responses and further contributing to confabulation (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

Overall, these characteristics of generative models highlight the importance of careful oversight and validation when using LLMs in applications where accuracy and reliability are critical.","Generative models like LLMs generate outputs that can lead to confabulations in GAI systems by approximating the statistical distribution of their training data. While this statistical prediction can result in factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce outputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This becomes particularly relevant in open-ended prompts for long-form responses and domains requiring contextual or domain expertise.",1.0,0.9095751510150262,1.0,0.8333333332916666,0.4040612942206161

 'requirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies’ reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \nand effectiveness concerns. \nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy,'
 '11 value chain  (e.g., data inputs , processing, GAI training, or deployment  environments ), conventional \ncybersecurity practices  may need to adapt or evolve . \nFor instance , prompt  injection  involves  modifying what  input is provided to a  GAI system  so that it  \nbehave s in unintended ways. In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious  prompts  and \ninput them directly to a GAI system , with a variety of  downstream negative consequences to \ninterconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection  attacks occur when  adversaries remotely (i.e., without \na direct interface) exploit LLM -integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be \nretrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit \nvulnerabilities by  steal ing proprietary  data  or running malicious code remotely  on a machine. Merely \nquerying  a closed production model can elicit  previously undisclosed information about that model . \nAnother cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning , in which  an adversary compromises  a training \ndataset used by a model to manipulate its output s or operation. Malicious tampering with  data or parts \nof the  model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics:  Privacy Enhanced, Safe , Secure and Resilient , Valid and Reliable  \n2.10. Intellectual Property  \nIntellectual property risks from  GAI systems may arise where the use of copyrighted works  is not a fair \nuse under the fair use doctrine. If a GAI system’s training data included copyrighted material, GAI \noutputs  displaying instances of  training data  memorization  (see Data Privacy above) could infringe on \ncopyright. \nHow GAI relates to copyright, including the status of  generated  content that is similar to but does not \nstrictly copy  w ork protected by copyright , is currently being debated in legal fora.  Similar discussions are']","Appropriate diligence on training data use is crucial for assessing intellectual property (IP) risks in AI systems in several ways:

1. **Understanding Data Sources**: Conducting thorough diligence involves identifying and documenting the sources of training data. This helps ensure that the data used is either owned by the organization, licensed appropriately, or falls under fair use. Knowing the origins of the data can mitigate the risk of infringing on third-party IP rights (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Evaluating Licensing Agreements**: Organizations should review and understand the licensing agreements associated with the training data. This includes checking for any restrictions on use, distribution, or modification of the data. Proper evaluation of these agreements can help prevent unintentional violations of IP rights (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Assessing Fair Use**: Diligence should include an assessment of whether the use of copyrighted materials in training data qualifies as fair use. This involves considering factors such as the purpose of use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the market for the original work. A clear understanding of fair use can help organizations navigate potential legal challenges (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Documenting Data Provenance**: Keeping detailed records of data provenance—where the data comes from and how it has been used—can provide a clear audit trail. This documentation is essential for demonstrating compliance with IP laws and can be valuable in case of disputes (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Identifying Potential Risks**: By conducting diligence on training data, organizations can identify potential IP risks early in the development process. This proactive approach allows for the implementation of risk mitigation strategies, such as seeking licenses for necessary data or modifying the training dataset to exclude sensitive materials (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Engaging Legal Expertise**: Involving legal experts during the diligence process can provide additional insights into IP risks associated with training data. Legal professionals can help interpret complex licensing agreements and advise on compliance with IP laws, ensuring that the organization is protected (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

By implementing these diligence practices, organizations can better assess and manage intellectual property risks associated with the use of training data in AI systems, ultimately leading to more responsible and legally compliant AI development.","Appropriate diligence on training data use can help assess intellectual property risks in AI systems by examining whether the use of proprietary or sensitive training data aligns with relevant laws. This includes evaluating the likelihood and magnitude of potential impacts, both beneficial and harmful, based on past uses of AI systems in similar contexts, public incident reports, feedback from external parties, and other relevant data.

Surveillance or monitoring systems should be subject to \nheightened oversight that includes at a minimum assessment of potential harms during design (before deploy -\nment) and in an ongoing manner, to ensure that the American public’s rights, opportunities, and access are protected. This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure there is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a specific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the system is in use. \nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of surveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the minimum number of subjects possible.

 'Risk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten -\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the potential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted communities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of the system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\n-\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention and mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating the safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\n-\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi -\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system. \n18'
 'In discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of these technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the design and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent procedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and receive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the need for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are genuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection of third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. \n57'
 'Data collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \nnarrow identified goals, to avoid ""mission creep.""  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be strictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible.

Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should attempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\n-\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks outweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not include sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not reasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \nPrivacy-preserving security. Entities creating, using, or governing automated systems should follow privacy and security best practices designed to ensure data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific consented use case.

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Establish specific, narrow goals for the automated system from the outset. This clarity helps prevent the system from being used for purposes beyond its original intent, thereby reducing the risk of mission creep (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Data Minimization**: Adopt data minimization principles by collecting only the data that is strictly necessary to achieve the defined objectives. Limiting data collection helps prevent the accumulation of unnecessary information that could be misused later (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **User Consent and Control**: Implement robust consent mechanisms that allow users to understand what data is being collected and how it will be used. Providing users with control over their data, including options to opt-out or delete their information, enhances privacy and fosters trust (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Regular Audits and Reviews**: Conduct regular audits of the automated system to ensure compliance with the original objectives and privacy standards. These reviews can help identify any deviations from the intended use and allow for corrective actions to be taken (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve stakeholders, including users and privacy advocates, in the design and implementation of the automated system. Their input can help identify potential risks and ensure that the system aligns with community values and expectations (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Transparent Communication**: Maintain transparency about the system's capabilities, limitations, and data usage. Clear communication helps users understand how their data is being handled and reinforces their sense of control over their information (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Establish Boundaries for Data Use**: Clearly document and communicate the specific contexts in which collected data will be used. This helps prevent the repurposing of data for unrelated objectives without proper reassessment of privacy risks (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

By implementing these strategies, organizations can effectively prevent mission creep while ensuring that privacy and user control are prioritized in the design and operation of automated systems.","Automated systems can prevent 'mission creep' and ensure privacy and user control by limiting data collection to specific, narrow goals that are strictly necessary for the identified purposes.

Here are some key points:

1. **Augmented Analysis**: GAI can assist human red-teamers by quickly analyzing vast amounts of data and generating potential attack scenarios or vulnerabilities that might not be immediately apparent. This capability allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the system's security posture (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Simulating Adversarial Behavior**: GAI can simulate various adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that could be used against a system. By generating realistic attack simulations, GAI helps human teams prepare for and respond to potential threats more effectively (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Utilizing GAI in red-teaming can be more cost-effective than relying solely on human red-teamers. GAI can handle repetitive tasks and preliminary assessments, allowing human experts to focus on more complex and nuanced evaluations (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Content Provenance Tracking**: GAI systems can incorporate mechanisms for tracking the origin and history of generated content. This includes metadata about the GAI model used, the date and time of content creation, and any modifications made. Such tracking enhances accountability and helps organizations understand the context of the generated outputs (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Incident Disclosure Protocols**: By integrating GAI with incident reporting frameworks, organizations can ensure that any incidents or anomalies identified during red-teaming exercises are documented and disclosed appropriately. This transparency is crucial for learning from incidents and improving future security measures (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Collaborative Feedback Loops**: GAI can facilitate continuous feedback loops between human red-teamers and the AI system. This collaboration allows for the refinement of both the GAI models and the red-teaming strategies, leading to more effective risk management and incident response (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Standardization of Reporting**: GAI can help standardize the documentation and reporting of red-teaming activities, making it easier to share findings and insights across teams. This standardization can improve the overall effectiveness of risk management efforts and enhance organizational learning (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

1. **Transparency**: Informing consumers about decisions made using automated systems promotes transparency in the lending process. Consumers have the right to know how their creditworthiness is assessed and what factors influenced the lender's decision (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Consumer Rights**: The FCRA grants consumers specific rights regarding their credit information, including the right to receive ""adverse action"" notices when credit is denied. By providing this information, lenders help ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and can take appropriate action if they believe they have been treated unfairly (Source: [document name], p.

3. **Opportunity for Correction**: When consumers are informed about the reasons for adverse decisions, they have the opportunity to review their credit reports and correct any inaccuracies. This can help improve their credit standing and ensure that future lending decisions are based on accurate information (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Accountability**: By disclosing the decision-making process, lenders are held accountable for their use of automated systems. This accountability is crucial for addressing potential biases or errors in the algorithms that may lead to unfair treatment of consumers (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Building Trust**: Providing clear explanations about automated decisions helps build trust between lenders and consumers. When consumers understand how decisions are made, they are more likely to feel confident in the lending process and the fairness of the outcomes (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

 'In addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback system in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is tested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human review against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have to wait—immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a remedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated card access system fails. \nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems are used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors diagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous outcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human oversight in such settings. \nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to provide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still in place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers often retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an airplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a misidentification.'
 'SAFE AND EFFECTIVE \nSYSTEMS \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nWhile technologies are being deployed to solve problems across a wide array of issues, our reliance on technology can \nalso lead to its use in situations where it has not yet been proven to work—either at all or within an acceptable range of error. In other cases, technologies do not work as intended or as promised, causing substantial and unjustified harm. Automated systems sometimes rely on data from other systems, including historical data, allowing irrelevant informa\n-\ntion from past decisions to infect decision-making in unrelated situations.  In some cases, technologies are purposeful -\nly designed to violate the safety of others, such as technologies designed to facilitate stalking; in other cases, intended or unintended uses lead to unintended harms. \nMany of the harms resulting from these technologies are preventable, and actions are already being taken to protect the public. Some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that key development decisions are vetted by an ethics review; others have identified and mitigated harms found through pre-deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes. Governments at all levels have existing public consulta\n-\ntion processes that may be applied when considering the use of new automated systems, and existing product develop -\nment and testing practices already protect the American public from many potential harms. \nStill, these kinds of practices are deployed too rarely and unevenly.

Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access.

1. **Accountability**: Transparency ensures that organizations are held accountable for the decisions made by automated systems. When individuals understand how decisions are made, they can identify and challenge any unfair or biased outcomes, promoting responsible use of technology (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Trust Building**: When organizations are transparent about their automated systems, it fosters trust among users. People are more likely to accept and engage with systems they understand, which can lead to greater user satisfaction and cooperation (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Informed Decision-Making**: Transparency allows individuals to make informed choices about their interactions with automated systems. When users know how their data is used and how decisions are made, they can better assess the risks and benefits associated with those systems (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Protection of Rights**: Automated systems can significantly affect individuals' rights and opportunities, such as in employment, credit, and healthcare. Transparency helps ensure that these systems operate fairly and do not infringe on individuals' rights, allowing for better protection against discrimination and bias (Source: [document name], p.

6. **Error Identification and Correction**: When automated systems are transparent, it becomes easier to identify errors or biases in their operation. This visibility allows for timely corrections and improvements, enhancing the overall effectiveness and fairness of the systems (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many jurisdictions require transparency in automated decision-making processes as part of regulatory frameworks. Adhering to these requirements not only ensures compliance but also demonstrates a commitment to ethical practices (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

In summary, public transparency in automated systems is essential for accountability, trust, informed decision-making, protection of rights, public engagement, error correction, and regulatory compliance, ultimately leading to more ethical and responsible use of technology.","Public transparency is crucial in automated systems affecting people's lives and decisions because it allows both the authorities and the public to understand why and how decisions are being made. Without transparency, individuals may be subject to decisions made by automated systems without any explanation or accountability, leading to potential errors, biases, and injustices. Transparency also enables experts to verify the reasonableness of recommendations before they are implemented, ensuring safety and efficacy.

How can governance principles manage risks of GAI effectively?,"['47 Appendix A.  Primary GAI Considerations  \nThe following primary considerations were derived as overarching themes from the GAI PWG \nconsultation process. These considerations (Governance, Pre- Deployment Testing, Content Provenance, \nand Incident Disclosure) are relevant  for volun tary use by any organization designing, developing, and \nusing GAI  and also inform the Actions to Manage GAI risks. Information included about the primary \nconsiderations is not exhaustive , but highlights the most relevant topics derived from the GAI PWG.  \nAcknowledgments: These considerations could not have been surfaced without the helpful analysis and \ncontributions from the community and NIST staﬀ GAI PWG leads: George Awad, Luca Belli, Harold Booth, \nMat Heyman, Yoo young Lee, Mark Pryzbocki, Reva Schwartz, Martin Stanley, and Kyra Yee.  \nA.1. Governance  \nA.1.1.  Overview  \nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks \nrelated to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their \nexisting risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may op t to revis e or update AI system risk levels to address \nthese unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be re -\nevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third -party considerations for governing across  \nthe AI value chain.  \nA.1.2.  Organizational  Governance  \nGAI opportunities, risks and long- term performance characteristics are typically less well -understood \nthan non- generative AI tools  and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. \nAccordingly, GAI may call for diﬀerent levels of oversight from AI Actors  or diﬀerent human- AI \nconﬁgurations in order to manage their risks eﬀectively. Organizations’ use of GAI systems may also \nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.'

Examples of the latter include  the expansion of “ algorithmic \nmonocultures ,3” resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on  access to \nopportunity, labor markets , and the creative economies .4 \n• Source of risk:  Risks may emerge from factors related to the de sign, training, or operation of  the \nGAI model itself, stemming in some cases from  GAI model or system inputs , and in other cases , \nfrom GAI system outputs.  Many GAI risks, however, originate from human  behavior , including \n \n \n3 “Algorithmic monocultures” refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm  in \nconsequential decision- making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility  by \nsystems  to correlated failures  (like unexpected shocks),  due to multiple actors relying on the  same algorithm.  \n4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and  labor markets.

 '11 value chain  (e.g., data inputs , processing, GAI training, or deployment  environments ), conventional \ncybersecurity practices  may need to adapt or evolve . \nFor instance , prompt  injection  involves  modifying what  input is provided to a  GAI system  so that it  \nbehave s in unintended ways. In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious  prompts  and \ninput them directly to a GAI system , with a variety of  downstream negative consequences to \ninterconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection  attacks occur when  adversaries remotely (i.e., without \na direct interface) exploit LLM -integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be \nretrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit \nvulnerabilities by  steal ing proprietary  data  or running malicious code remotely  on a machine. Merely \nquerying  a closed production model can elicit  previously undisclosed information about that model . \nAnother cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning , in which  an adversary compromises  a training \ndataset used by a model to manipulate its output s or operation.

Similar discussions are']","Governance principles can effectively manage the risks associated with Generative AI (GAI) through several key strategies:

1. **Establishing Clear Policies**: Organizations should develop and implement clear policies that outline the acceptable use of GAI technologies. These policies should define the scope of GAI applications, the types of data that can be used, and the ethical standards that must be adhered to (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Risk Assessment Frameworks**: Implementing comprehensive risk assessment frameworks allows organizations to identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks associated with GAI. This includes assessing risks at various stages of the AI lifecycle, from design and development to deployment and decommissioning (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Human Oversight and Review**: Governance structures should include provisions for human oversight and review of GAI outputs. This ensures that decisions made by GAI systems are subject to human judgment, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where the consequences of errors can be significant (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Transparency and Accountability**: Organizations should promote transparency in their GAI systems by documenting decision-making processes and providing clear explanations of how outputs are generated. This accountability helps build trust and allows stakeholders to understand the rationale behind automated decisions (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging a diverse range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, and community representatives, in the governance process can provide valuable insights into potential risks and ethical considerations. This collaborative approach can help ensure that GAI systems align with societal values and expectations (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Regular Audits and Compliance Checks**: Conducting regular audits of GAI systems can help organizations ensure compliance with established policies and regulations. These audits should assess the effectiveness of risk management strategies and identify areas for improvement (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Training and Education**: Providing training and education for employees on the ethical use of GAI technologies is essential. This helps create a culture of responsibility and awareness regarding the potential risks and implications of GAI applications (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

8. **Incident Reporting and Response**: Establishing clear protocols for incident reporting and response allows organizations to address any issues that arise from GAI use promptly. This includes mechanisms for disclosing incidents and learning from them to improve future practices (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

By implementing these governance principles, organizations can effectively manage the risks associated with Generative AI, ensuring that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically while maximizing their benefits.","Governance principles can be used to manage risks related to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications.

1. **Bias Mitigation**: Accurate data documentation helps identify and address biases in training datasets. If the data used to train AI models is not accurately reviewed, it may contain inherent biases that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. By ensuring accuracy, organizations can implement strategies to mitigate these biases, leading to fairer AI systems (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Intellectual Property Protection**: Accurate documentation of data sources and usage is essential for protecting intellectual property rights. Organizations must ensure that they have the proper licenses and permissions for the data they use. Inaccuracies in this documentation can lead to legal disputes or unintentional infringement on third-party rights, which can have significant financial and reputational consequences (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Integrity of AI Outputs**: The integrity of AI outputs relies heavily on the quality and accuracy of the data used in the training process. If the data is inaccurate or poorly documented, the resulting AI models may produce unreliable or misleading outputs. This can undermine trust in the AI system and lead to negative consequences for users and stakeholders (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Risk Management**: Accurate data documentation is vital for effective risk management throughout the AI life cycle. By maintaining precise records of data sources, processing methods, and model performance, organizations can better assess potential risks associated with GAI applications. This includes understanding how data quality impacts model behavior and identifying areas where risks may arise (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many jurisdictions have regulations governing data use, privacy, and AI applications. Accurate documentation helps organizations comply with these regulations by providing a clear audit trail of data handling practices. This compliance is essential for avoiding legal penalties and maintaining public trust (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Facilitating Accountability**: Accurate documentation of data and decision-making processes enhances accountability within organizations. When stakeholders can trace the origins and transformations of data, it becomes easier to hold individuals and teams accountable for the outcomes produced by AI systems (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Maintaining accurate records allows organizations to learn from past experiences and improve their AI systems over time. By analyzing documented data and outcomes, organizations can identify patterns, refine their models, and enhance their overall AI strategies (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

In summary, accuracy in reviewing and documenting data throughout the AI life cycle is essential for mitigating bias, protecting intellectual property, ensuring integrity, managing risks, complying with regulations, facilitating accountability, and promoting continuous improvement in AI systems.","Accuracy is crucial in reviewing and documenting data throughout the AI life cycle to ensure the data's reliability, representativeness, relevance, and suitability at different stages.

1. **Structured Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement structured feedback tools, such as surveys or rating systems, that allow users to provide specific input on AI-generated content. These tools can include questions related to the relevance, accuracy, and alignment of the content with organizational values (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Participatory Engagement**: Engage users in participatory feedback sessions, such as focus groups or workshops, where they can discuss their experiences with AI-generated content. This qualitative feedback can provide deeper insights into user perceptions and values, helping organizations align their AI outputs with user expectations (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish mechanisms for continuous monitoring of user feedback over time. By regularly analyzing feedback trends, organizations can identify shifts in quality or user satisfaction, allowing for timely adjustments to the AI systems and content generation processes (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Feedback Loops**: Create feedback loops where user input is not only collected but also acted upon. Communicate to users how their feedback has influenced changes in AI-generated content, reinforcing the importance of their input and fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Alignment with Values**: Develop a framework for evaluating AI-generated content against organizational values. This framework can include criteria for assessing whether the content promotes inclusivity, fairness, and ethical considerations. User feedback can then be used to refine these criteria and ensure ongoing alignment (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Diverse User Representation**: Ensure that feedback is collected from a diverse range of users to capture different perspectives and values. This diversity can help organizations identify potential biases in AI-generated content and make necessary adjustments to improve quality and relevance (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Quality Metrics Development**: Develop metrics to evaluate the quality of AI-generated content based on user feedback. These metrics can include measures of accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction, providing a quantitative basis for assessing shifts in quality over time (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

8. **Transparency in Feedback Processes**: Maintain transparency about how user feedback is collected, analyzed, and utilized. This transparency builds trust with users and encourages more honest and constructive feedback, ultimately leading to better alignment with values and improved content quality (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

Here are some key ways these laws help:

1. **Opportunity for Correction**: Ballot curing laws provide voters with the opportunity to correct any issues identified with their mail-in or absentee ballots. If a signature on a ballot does not match the signature on file, these laws often allow voters to verify their identity and submit a new signature or provide additional information to confirm their eligibility (Source: [Ballotpedia], p. [1]).

2. **Communication from Election Officials**: Many ballot curing processes require election officials to notify voters when there is a problem with their ballot. This communication can take the form of direct phone calls, emails, or mail, informing voters of the specific issue and guiding them on how to resolve it (Source: [Ballotpedia], p. [1]).

3. **Extended Timeframes**: Ballot curing laws often establish a ""cure period,"" which is a designated timeframe during which voters can address issues with their ballots. This extension allows voters to take the necessary steps to ensure their votes are counted, rather than being disenfranchised due to a technicality (Source: [Bipartisan Policy Center], p. [1]).

4. **Inclusivity for Diverse Voter Populations**: These laws are particularly important for voters who may face challenges with signature matching systems, such as individuals with disabilities, those who have changed their names, or voters with shorter or hyphenated names. By allowing for corrections, ballot curing laws help ensure that these voters are not unfairly disenfranchised (Source: [VentureBeat], p. [1]).

5. **Strengthening Voter Confidence**: By providing mechanisms for voters to address ballot issues, ballot curing laws can enhance public confidence in the electoral process. Voters are more likely to participate when they know there are safeguards in place to ensure their votes can be counted, even if initial issues arise (Source: [Bipartisan Policy Center], p. [1]).

Overall, ballot curing laws serve as an essential safeguard in the voting process, helping to mitigate the limitations of signature matching systems and ensuring that all eligible voters have the opportunity to have their voices heard.","Ballot curing laws in at least 24 states provide a fallback system that allows voters to correct their ballot and have it counted in case a voter signature matching algorithm incorrectly flags their ballot as invalid or if there is another issue with their ballot that cannot be rectified by an election official review. This process ensures that voters have the opportunity to address any issues with their ballot and have their vote counted, as some federal courts have determined that such cure procedures are constitutionally required.",1.0,0.9329417485315551,0.6666666666666666,0.99999999995,0.8833405177012349

1. **Diverse Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement structured feedback mechanisms that solicit input from a diverse range of users, including those from underrepresented groups. This feedback can help identify potential biases in the GAI outputs and ensure that the content produced is equitable and inclusive (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Equity-Focused Red-Teaming**: Conduct red-teaming exercises specifically focused on equity assessments. This involves assembling teams that include individuals with expertise in social justice, equity, and diversity to evaluate the GAI system's outputs for potential biases and discriminatory patterns (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Scenario Testing**: Use red-teaming to simulate various scenarios that reflect different demographic groups and contexts. This testing can help identify how the GAI system performs across diverse populations and whether it produces equitable outcomes (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Transparency in Processes**: Ensure that the processes for collecting feedback and conducting red-teaming are transparent. Documenting the methodologies used, the criteria for evaluation, and the outcomes of these assessments can help build trust and accountability in the GAI system (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Iterative Improvement**: Use the insights gained from feedback and red-teaming to iteratively improve the GAI system. This includes refining the training data, adjusting algorithms, and implementing changes based on user input to enhance equity and transparency in the content produced (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Public Reporting**: Regularly publish reports on the findings from feedback and red-teaming activities, highlighting any identified biases and the steps taken to address them. This transparency can help stakeholders understand the organization's commitment to equity and accountability (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Engagement with Affected Communities**: Actively engage with communities that may be impacted by the GAI system. Gathering input from these groups can provide valuable perspectives on equity issues and help ensure that the content produced aligns with their needs and values (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

1. **Equity Assessments in Design**: Incorporate equity assessments during the design phase of algorithm development. This involves evaluating the potential impact of the algorithm on different demographic groups and identifying any biases that may arise from the data or model design. Engaging diverse stakeholders in this process can provide valuable insights (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Diverse Data Collection**: Ensure that the data used to train algorithms is representative of the populations it will affect. This includes actively seeking out data from underrepresented groups to avoid biases that can lead to discriminatory outcomes. Data collection should also consider intersectional factors, such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

3. **Regular Disparity Testing**: Conduct regular disparity testing to assess the algorithm's performance across different demographic groups. This involves analyzing the outcomes produced by the algorithm to identify any significant disparities that may indicate discrimination. If disparities are found, organizations should take corrective actions to address them (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

4. **Algorithmic Impact Assessments**: Implement algorithmic impact assessments that evaluate the potential social and ethical implications of the algorithm before deployment. These assessments should include considerations of fairness, accountability, and transparency, and should be made public whenever possible (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with affected communities and stakeholders throughout the algorithm development process. This can include public consultations, focus groups, and partnerships with advocacy organizations. Their input can help identify potential biases and ensure that the algorithm serves the needs of all users (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback**: Establish mechanisms for continuous monitoring of the algorithm's performance post-deployment. This includes collecting user feedback and analyzing outcomes to identify any emerging issues related to discrimination. Organizations should be prepared to make adjustments based on this ongoing evaluation (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Training and Awareness**: Provide training for developers and stakeholders on the importance of equity and the risks of algorithmic discrimination. This training should cover best practices for data collection, model development, and the ethical implications of AI technologies (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

8. **Clear Accountability Structures**: Create clear accountability structures within organizations to ensure that there are designated individuals or teams responsible for overseeing equity assessments and addressing any identified issues. This accountability is crucial for fostering a culture of responsibility regarding algorithmic fairness (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

This assessment should determine the level of risk associated with the system's use in specific contexts, such as healthcare, criminal justice, or finance, where the stakes are particularly high (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

2. **Use of Explainable Models**: Design the system using explainable models that allow stakeholders to understand how decisions are made. This means employing algorithms that can be easily interpreted and explained, rather than relying on ""black box"" approaches that obscure the decision-making process (Source: [document name], p.

4. **User-Centric Design**: Ensure that the explanations are tailored to the needs of the end-users. This involves considering the target audience's level of expertise and providing explanations that are meaningful and relevant to their context, which enhances the likelihood that the explanations will be understood and accepted (Source: [document name], p.

5. **Error Range and Uncertainty Reporting**: Include information about error ranges and uncertainties in the explanations provided by the system. This helps users understand the limitations of the system's predictions and decisions, fostering a more realistic view of its capabilities (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

6. **Continuous Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish mechanisms for continuous feedback from users and stakeholders. This feedback can be used to refine the explanatory features and ensure that they remain effective and relevant over time (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

7. **Documentation and Reporting**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the system's design, decision-making processes, and the explanations provided. Regular reporting on the system's performance and the effectiveness of its explanatory mechanisms can enhance accountability and transparency (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

8. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve relevant stakeholders, including affected communities and experts, in the design process. Their insights can help identify potential risks and ensure that the system operates within ethical and legal boundaries (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).

By integrating these principles into the design of automated systems, organizations can enhance transparency and accountability, particularly in high-risk environments where the implications of decisions can significantly impact individuals and communities.","In settings where the consequences are high as determined by a risk assessment, or extensive oversight is expected (e.g., in criminal justice or some public sector settings), explanatory mechanisms should be built into the system design so that the system’s full behavior can be explained in advance (i.e., only fully transparent models should be used), rather than as an after-the-decision interpretation. The extent of explanation provided should be tailored to the risk level.",1.0,0.9578715395345266,1.0,0.999999999975,0.4546973605750549
