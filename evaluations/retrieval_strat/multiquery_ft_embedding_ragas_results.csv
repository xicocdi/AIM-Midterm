These expectations are explained below. \nProvide clear, timely, understandable, and accessible notice of use and explanations \nGenerally accessible plain language documentation. The entity responsible for using the automated \nsystem should ensure that documentation describing the overall system (including any human components) is \npublic and easy to find. The documentation should describe, in plain language, how the system works and how \nany automated component is used to determine an action or decision. It should also include expectations about \nreporting described throughout this framework, such as the algorithmic impact assessments described as \npart of Algorithmic Discrimination Protections. \nAccount able.

 'NOTICE & \nEXPLANATION \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nAutomated systems now determine opportunities, from employment to credit, and directly shape the American \npublic’s experiences, from the courtroom to online classrooms, in ways that profoundly impact people’s lives. But this expansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a hiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\n-\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting decisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. Notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\n-\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. Clear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\n-\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a particular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, unaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement.'

 ""Providing notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the validity and reasonable use of automated systems. \n• A lawyer representing an older client with disabilities who had been cut off from Medicaid-funded home\nhealth-care assistance couldn't determine why\n, especially since the decision went against historical access\npractices.

1. **Transparency**: It ensures that individuals are aware when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect them. This transparency is crucial for building trust between the public and the entities deploying these systems.

2. **Accountability**: By clearly identifying the entities responsible for the design and use of automated systems, it holds them accountable for the decisions made by these systems. This accountability is essential for addressing any potential harms or errors that may arise from automated decision-making.

3. **Informed Decision-Making**: Notice and explanation allow individuals to understand how and why decisions are made, which is vital for them to contest or appeal those decisions if necessary. For example, if someone is denied a loan or a job, knowing the criteria used by the automated system can help them address any inaccuracies or biases.

4. **Protection of Rights**: Automated systems can significantly impact people's lives, from employment opportunities to legal outcomes. Providing notice and explanations helps protect individuals' rights by ensuring they have the information needed to understand and challenge decisions that may adversely affect them.

5. **Encouraging Fairness**: When individuals are informed about the use of automated systems and the rationale behind decisions, it can help mitigate biases and promote fairness. This is particularly important in sensitive areas like criminal justice, healthcare, and employment.

6. **Facilitating Oversight**: Clear notice and explanations enable oversight bodies, researchers, and the public to scrutinize automated systems, ensuring they operate fairly and effectively. This oversight is crucial for identifying and correcting any issues that may arise.

In summary, the legal requirement for notice and explanation in automated systems is essential for ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness, ultimately protecting individuals' rights and fostering trust in these technologies (Source: [document name], p.

1. **Identifying Potential Risks**: GAI red-teaming involves simulating various scenarios to uncover potential adverse behaviors or outcomes of a GAI system. By engaging diverse teams, including domain experts and general users, organizations can identify risks that may not be apparent during the development phase (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Diverse Perspectives**: Including individuals from different backgrounds and experiences in red-teaming exercises helps to surface a wide range of potential issues, including biases and ethical concerns. This diversity can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how the GAI system may perform across different contexts and populations (Source: [document name], p.

3. **Testing Safeguards**: Red-teaming allows organizations to stress-test the safeguards and controls implemented in GAI systems. By simulating attacks or misuse, teams can evaluate the effectiveness of these safeguards and make necessary adjustments to enhance the system's resilience (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Feedback for Improvement**: The structured feedback gathered from red-teaming exercises can inform updates and improvements to the GAI system. This iterative process helps ensure that the system evolves in response to identified risks and user needs (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Enhancing Accountability**: By documenting the findings from red-teaming exercises, organizations can create a clear record of identified risks and the steps taken to address them. This accountability is crucial for regulatory compliance and for building trust with stakeholders (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

For example, the \nanecdotal testing of GAI system capabilities through video games or standardized tests designed for \nhumans (e.g., intelligence tests, professional licensing exams) does not guarantee GAI system validity or \nreliability in those domains. Similarly, jailbreaking or prompt  engineering tests may not systematically \nasse ss validity or reliability risks.  \nMeasurement gaps can arise from mismatches between laboratory and real -world settings. Current \ntesting approaches often remain focused on laboratory conditions or restricted to benchmark test \ndatasets and in silico techniques that may not extrapolate well to —or directly assess GAI impacts in real -\nworld conditions.

1. **Limited Contextual Relevance**: Laboratory testing often occurs in controlled environments that do not accurately reflect the complexities and variabilities of real-world situations. As a result, the performance of GAI systems may appear more reliable in tests than they would be in actual deployment contexts, leading to overconfidence in their capabilities (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Inadequate Risk Identification**: Current pre-deployment testing methodologies may not effectively capture the full range of risks associated with GAI systems when they are used in diverse real-world scenarios. This can lead to significant gaps in understanding potential negative impacts, such as biases or unintended consequences that may arise during actual use (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Prompt Sensitivity Issues**: GAI systems can be highly sensitive to the prompts they receive. Testing in a lab may not account for the varied and unpredictable ways users might interact with the system in real life. This sensitivity can lead to different outputs and behaviors that were not anticipated during testing, resulting in performance discrepancies (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Benchmark Limitations**: Many pre-deployment tests rely on benchmark datasets that may not represent the diversity of data encountered in real-world applications. This can create a false sense of security regarding the system's reliability and effectiveness, as the benchmarks may not adequately reflect the challenges faced in practical use (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Longitudinal Impact Assessment**: Current testing approaches often fail to consider the long-term effects of GAI systems on users and communities. Without longitudinal studies, it is challenging to assess how these systems might evolve over time or how they might impact social, political, and economic dynamics (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Feedback Mechanisms**: The lack of structured public feedback during the testing phase can hinder the ability to calibrate and verify the performance of GAI systems. Engaging with users and stakeholders can provide valuable insights that are often missing in laboratory settings, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the system's real-world implications (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

In summary, measurement gaps between laboratory and real-world settings can lead to an incomplete understanding of GAI systems' performance, risks, and impacts, ultimately affecting their safe and effective deployment. Addressing these gaps is crucial for ensuring that GAI technologies are reliable and beneficial in practice.","Measurement gaps between laboratory and real-world settings can impact the assessment of GAI systems in the context of pre-deployment testing by limiting the extrapolation of results from laboratory conditions to real-world scenarios.

Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \nnarrow identified goals, to avoid ""mission creep.""  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be strictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible. Data collected based on these identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for new privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, which may include express consent. Clear timelines for data retention should be established, with data deleted as soon as possible in accordance with legal or policy-based limitations. Determined data retention timelines should be documented and justi\n-\nfied. \nRisk identification and mitigation. Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should attempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\n-\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks outweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not include sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not reasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \nPrivacy-preserving security. Entities creating, using, or governing automated systems should follow privacy and security best practices designed to ensure data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific consented use case.

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Start by establishing specific, narrow goals for the automated system. This involves identifying the primary purpose of the system and the specific outcomes it aims to achieve. Clear objectives help ensure that data collection is focused and relevant (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Conduct a Data Necessity Assessment**: Evaluate the data needed to achieve the defined objectives. This assessment should determine what data is strictly necessary and avoid collecting any additional information that does not directly contribute to the goals. This helps minimize the risk of collecting excessive data that could lead to mission creep (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Implement Data Minimization Principles**: Adopt data minimization practices by collecting only the data that is essential for the identified goals. This principle not only reduces the risk of mission creep but also enhances user privacy and data protection (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Establish Context-Specific Use Cases**: Clearly define the context in which the data will be used. Data collected for one specific purpose should not be repurposed for another without a thorough assessment of new privacy risks and obtaining express consent from users if necessary (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Set Clear Data Retention Timelines**: Establish and document clear timelines for data retention. Data should be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the identified goals, in accordance with legal or policy-based limitations. This helps prevent the accumulation of unnecessary data over time (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Regularly Review and Update Policies**: Implement a process for regularly reviewing and updating data collection policies and practices. This ensures that the system remains aligned with its original objectives and adapts to any changes in context or legal requirements (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve relevant stakeholders, including users, legal experts, and ethicists, in the development and implementation of data collection practices. Their input can help identify potential risks and ensure that the system operates within ethical and legal boundaries (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

 'DATA PRIVACY \nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE\nReal-life examples of how these principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practical \ntechnical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \nThe Privacy Act of 1974 requires privacy protections for personal information in federal \nrecords systems, including limits on data retention, and also provides individuals a general \nright to access and correct their data. Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is “relevant and necessary” to accomplish an agency’s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows for individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not included under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\n-\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular system of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. Furthe r, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \ncomply with the Privacy Act’s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or correct an individual’s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimel y, \nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual’s “qualifications, characte r, rights, … \nopportunities…, or benefits .” \nNIST’s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for'

1. **Risk Assessment**: Begin with a thorough risk assessment to identify the potential consequences of automated decisions in high-risk settings, such as criminal justice or healthcare. This assessment will guide the level of transparency required (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Use of Fully Transparent Models**: In high-risk environments, it is essential to utilize fully transparent models that allow stakeholders to understand how decisions are made. This means opting for algorithms that provide clear, interpretable outputs rather than relying on ""black box"" models (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Explanatory Interfaces**: Develop user-friendly interfaces that present explanations of the system's decisions in an accessible manner. These interfaces should provide insights into the factors influencing decisions, making it easier for users to comprehend the rationale behind outcomes (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Documentation of Decision-Making Processes**: Maintain comprehensive documentation that outlines the decision-making processes of the automated system. This documentation should detail the data inputs, algorithms used, and the reasoning behind specific outputs, ensuring that stakeholders can trace how decisions are reached (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Error Range Calculations**: Include error ranges in the explanations provided by the system. This helps users understand the potential variability in outcomes and the confidence level associated with specific decisions, which is particularly important in high-stakes scenarios (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the explanations and decisions made by the system. This feedback can be used to refine the explanatory mechanisms and improve the overall transparency and accountability of the system (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Regular Audits and Updates**: Conduct regular audits of the system to ensure that the explanatory mechanisms remain effective and relevant. This includes updating the system based on new findings, user feedback, and changes in the regulatory landscape (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

It also addresses third -party considerations for governing across  \nthe AI value chain.  \nA.1.2.  Organizational  Governance  \nGAI opportunities, risks and long- term performance characteristics are typically less well -understood \nthan non- generative AI tools  and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. \nAccordingly, GAI may call for diﬀerent levels of oversight from AI Actors  or diﬀerent human- AI \nconﬁgurations in order to manage their risks eﬀectively. Organizations’ use of GAI systems may also \nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.'

AI RMF  proﬁle s assist organizations in deciding how to \nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well -aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \nrequirements and best practices, and reﬂects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \nproﬁles , this proﬁle  oﬀers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \nand for GAI as a technology.  \nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document is an AI RMF cross -sectoral proﬁ le.

Information Integrity ; Value Chain']","Organizations should consider several risks associated with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) during the development and deployment of AI systems. Here are some key examples:

1. **Bias and Discrimination**: GAI systems can perpetuate or even amplify biases present in the training data. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in applications such as hiring, lending, or law enforcement, where biased outputs can adversely affect individuals or groups (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Misinformation and Disinformation**: GAI can generate highly convincing but false information, which can be used to spread misinformation or disinformation. This poses risks to public trust, especially in sensitive areas like politics, health, and safety (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Content Authenticity and Provenance**: The ability of GAI to create synthetic content, such as deepfakes, raises concerns about the authenticity of information. Organizations must implement mechanisms to track the provenance of content to ensure users can distinguish between genuine and AI-generated materials (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: GAI systems can introduce new security risks, such as susceptibility to adversarial attacks, where malicious actors manipulate inputs to produce harmful outputs. This can compromise the integrity and reliability of the system (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Privacy Concerns**: The use of personal data to train GAI models can lead to privacy violations if sensitive information is not adequately protected. Organizations must ensure compliance with data protection regulations and implement robust privacy measures (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Operational Risks**: GAI systems may behave unpredictably, especially in novel situations not covered during training. This unpredictability can lead to operational failures or unintended consequences, necessitating careful monitoring and management (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Intellectual Property Issues**: The generation of content by GAI raises questions about ownership and copyright. Organizations must navigate the complexities of intellectual property rights related to AI-generated works (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

8. **Algorithmic Monocultures**: The widespread use of similar GAI models can lead to algorithmic monocultures, where multiple organizations rely on the same algorithms, increasing vulnerability to correlated failures and systemic risks (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

By being aware of these risks, organizations can take proactive steps to mitigate them, ensuring that their GAI systems are developed and deployed responsibly and ethically.","Organizations need to consider various GAI risks in the development and deployment of AI systems, including unacceptable use identified by stakeholder communities, harmful bias and homogenization, dangerous, violent, or hateful content, immature safety or risk cultures related to AI and GAI design, development, and deployment, public information integrity risks impacting democratic processes, unknown long-term performance characteristics of GAI, and risks related to generating illegal content or violating laws.",1.0,0.9441925829937231,1.0,0.9999999999875,0.26607719724614826

 ""Providing notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access.

1. **Data Quality Assurance**: Ensure that the data used to train and operate the automated system is accurate, representative, and relevant. Regularly review and document the quality of data at different stages of the AI lifecycle to prevent biases and inaccuracies from affecting the explanations (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Transparent Algorithms**: Use algorithms that are inherently interpretable and transparent. This means selecting models that allow for clear understanding of how inputs are transformed into outputs, making it easier to explain decisions to users (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Error Range Calculations**: Include error ranges in the explanations provided by the system. This helps users understand the potential variability in outcomes and the confidence level associated with specific decisions, which is crucial for assessing the validity of the explanations (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **User-Centric Design**: Tailor explanations to the specific needs and understanding of the target audience. This involves using plain language and relevant examples to ensure that users can easily grasp the rationale behind decisions (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Regular Testing and Validation**: Implement ongoing testing and validation processes to assess the accuracy and reliability of the explanations. This includes comparing the system's outputs against known ground truth data and using various evaluation methods (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the explanations they receive. This feedback can be used to refine the explanation processes and improve the overall validity and clarity of the information provided (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Documentation and Accountability**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the decision-making processes and the rationale behind the explanations. This documentation should clearly identify the entities responsible for the design and use of the automated system, ensuring accountability (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

8. **Incorporate Human Oversight**: Implement human oversight in the decision-making process, especially in high-stakes situations. Human operators can review and validate the explanations provided by the automated system, ensuring that they align with intended purposes and ethical standards (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

By adopting these practices, organizations can enhance the validity of explanations given by automated systems, fostering trust and ensuring that users can make informed decisions based on the information provided.","The explanation provided by a system should accurately reflect the factors and influences that led to a particular decision, and should be meaningful for the particular customization based on purpose, target, and level of risk.

How do generative models like LLMs generate outputs that can lead to confabulations in GAI systems?,"['6 2.2. Confabulation  \n“Confabulation” refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and conﬁdently present \nerroneous or false content in response to prompts . Confabulations also include generated outputs that \ndiverge from the prompts  or other  input  or that contradict previously generated statements in the same \ncontext. Th ese phenomena are colloquially also referred to as “hallucination s” or “fabrication s.” \nConfabulations can occur across GAI outputs  and contexts .9,10 Confabulations are a natural result of the \nway generative models  are designed : they  generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution \nof their training data ; for example,  LLMs  predict the next  token or word  in a sentence or phrase . While \nsuch statistical  prediction can produce factual ly accurate  and consistent  outputs , it can  also produce \noutputs that are factually inaccurat e or internally inconsistent . This dynamic is particularly relevant when \nit comes to  open -ended prompts  for long- form responses  and in domains  which require highly \ncontextual and/or  domain expertise.  \nRisks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content  – often  due to the conﬁdent nature \nof the response  – leading users to act upon or promote the false information.  This poses a challenge  for \nmany real -world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient \ninformation reports could  cause doctors to make  incorrect diagnoses  and/or recommend the wrong \ntreatments.  Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor  when integrating GAI \ninto applications involving  consequential  decision making. \nGAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations  that purport to justify or explain the \nsystem’s answer , which may further mislead  humans into inappropriately trusting the system’s output. \nFor instance, LLMs  sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the'

Environmental Impacts  \nTraining, maint aining, and operating (running inference  on) GAI systems are resource -intensive  activities , \nwith potentially large energy and environmental footprints. Energy and carbon emissions vary  based on \nwhat is being done with the  GAI model (i.e., pre -training, ﬁne -tuning, inference), the modality  of the \ncontent , hardware used, and type of task or application . \nCurrent e stimates suggest that training a single transformer  LLM can emit as much carbon  as 300 round-\ntrip ﬂights between San Francisco and New York.  In a study comparing energy consumption and carbon \nemissions for LLM inference, generative tasks ( e.g., text summarization) were found to be more energy - \nand carbon -i ntensive th an discriminative or non- generative tasks  (e.g., text classiﬁcation).  \nMethods for creating smaller versions of train ed models, such as model distillation or compression, \ncould reduce  environmental impacts at inference time, but training and tuning such models may still \ncontribute to their environmental impacts .

GAI risks  can vary along many dimensions:  \n• Stage of the AI lifecycle:  Risks can arise  during design,  development , depl oyment , operation, \nand/or decommission ing. \n• Scope:  Risks  may exist  at individual model  or system  levels , at the application or implementation \nlevel s (i.e., for a speciﬁc use case), or at the ecosystem level  – that is, beyond a single  system or \norganizational context . Examples of the latter include  the expansion of “ algorithmic \nmonocultures ,3” resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on  access to \nopportunity, labor markets , and the creative economies .4 \n• Source of risk:  Risks may emerge from factors related to the de sign, training, or operation of  the \nGAI model itself, stemming in some cases from  GAI model or system inputs , and in other cases , \nfrom GAI system outputs.  Many GAI risks, however, originate from human  behavior , including \n \n \n3 “Algorithmic monocultures” refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm  in \nconsequential decision- making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility  by \nsystems  to correlated failures  (like unexpected shocks),  due to multiple actors relying on the  same algorithm.  \n4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and  labor markets. Fewer studies have examined \nthe impact of GAI on the labor market , though some industry surveys indicate that  that both emp loyees and \nemployers are pondering this disruption.'

Automation bias can exacerbate other risks of GAI, such as risks of confabulation \nor risks of bias or homogenization.  \nThere may also be concerns  about  emotional entanglement  between humans and GAI systems, which']","Generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), produce outputs that may result in confabulations due to the way they are designed and operate. Here are the key factors that contribute to this phenomenon:

1. **Statistical Prediction**: LLMs generate text by predicting the next word or token in a sequence based on the statistical patterns learned from their training data. This means they do not have an understanding of the content in the same way humans do; instead, they rely on probabilities derived from the data they were trained on. As a result, they can produce outputs that sound plausible but are factually incorrect or nonsensical (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Open-Ended Prompts**: When given open-ended prompts, LLMs can generate long-form responses that may diverge from the original context or prompt. This can lead to inconsistencies within the generated text, as the model may introduce information that is not relevant or accurate, resulting in confabulated content (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Lack of Contextual Understanding**: LLMs do not possess true contextual understanding or domain expertise. They generate responses based on patterns rather than comprehension, which can lead to outputs that contradict previous statements or lack coherence when addressing complex topics (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Confident Presentation**: LLMs often present their outputs with a high degree of confidence, which can mislead users into believing that the information is accurate. This confidence can lead users to accept and act upon false information without critical evaluation, increasing the risk of spreading misinformation (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Confabulated Logic and Citations**: In some cases, LLMs may generate logical steps or citations to support their answers, even when these are fabricated or incorrect. This can further mislead users into trusting the outputs, as the model appears to provide justifications for its responses (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

Overall, the combination of statistical prediction, lack of true understanding, and the confident presentation of outputs contributes to the occurrence of confabulations in generative AI systems. Organizations using LLMs must be aware of these risks and implement measures to mitigate them, especially in applications involving critical decision-making.","Generative models like LLMs generate outputs that can lead to confabulations in GAI systems by approximating the statistical distribution of their training data. While this statistical prediction can result in factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce outputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This becomes particularly relevant in open-ended prompts for long-form responses and domains requiring contextual or domain expertise.",1.0,0.9104152047724899,1.0,0.8736394557698324,0.39538357417853764

1. **Identifying Data Sources**: Conducting thorough diligence helps organizations trace the origins of the training data used in AI systems. By understanding where the data comes from, organizations can determine whether they have the right to use that data and whether it infringes on any existing IP rights (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Evaluating Licensing Agreements**: Diligence allows organizations to review licensing agreements associated with the training data. This includes checking whether the data is licensed for commercial use, whether there are any restrictions, and ensuring compliance with the terms of use. This step is essential to avoid potential legal disputes over unauthorized use of copyrighted material (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Assessing Data Quality and Ownership**: By examining the quality and ownership of the training data, organizations can identify potential risks related to data that may be proprietary or sensitive. This assessment helps ensure that the data used does not violate any IP rights or privacy laws, which could lead to legal liabilities (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Mitigating Risks of Data Memorization**: Diligence can help organizations understand the risks of data memorization, where AI models inadvertently reproduce copyrighted or proprietary content from their training data. By assessing the training data, organizations can implement measures to minimize the likelihood of such occurrences, such as filtering out sensitive or proprietary information (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Documenting Compliance Efforts**: Maintaining records of the diligence process demonstrates an organization's commitment to IP compliance. This documentation can be valuable in case of audits or legal challenges, as it shows that the organization took reasonable steps to assess and mitigate IP risks associated with its AI systems (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Engaging Legal Expertise**: Appropriate diligence often involves consulting with legal experts who specialize in IP law. Their insights can help organizations navigate complex legal landscapes and ensure that their use of training data aligns with IP regulations and best practices (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

By implementing appropriate diligence on training data use, organizations can effectively assess and manage intellectual property risks in their AI systems, thereby reducing the likelihood of legal issues and fostering responsible AI development.","Appropriate diligence on training data use can help assess intellectual property risks in AI systems by examining whether the use of proprietary or sensitive training data aligns with relevant laws.

 'ABOUT THIS  FRAMEWORK\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a set of five principles and associated practices to help guide the \ndesign, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the rights of the American public in the age of \nartificial intel-ligence. Developed through extensive consultation with the American public, these principles are \na blueprint for building and deploying automated systems that are aligned with democratic values and protect \ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights includes this Foreword, the five \nprinciples, notes on Applying the The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, and a Technical Companion that gives \nconcrete steps that can be taken by many kinds of organizations—from governments at all levels to companies of \nall sizes—to uphold these values. Experts from across the private sector, governments, and international \nconsortia have published principles and frameworks to guide the responsible use of automated systems; this \nframework provides a national values statement and toolkit that is sector-agnostic to inform building these \nprotections into policy, practice, or the technological design process.  Where existing law or policy—such as \nsector-specific privacy laws and oversight requirements—do not already provide guidance, the Blueprint for an \nAI Bill of Rights should be used to inform policy decisions.\nLISTENING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has led a year-long process to seek and distill input \nfrom people across the country—from impacted communities and industry stakeholders to technology develop-\ners and other experts across fields and sectors, as well as policymakers throughout the Federal government—on \nthe issue of algorithmic and data-driven harms and potential remedies.

How can automated systems prevent 'mission creep' while ensuring privacy and user control?,"['DATA PRIVACY \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nProtect the public from unchecked surveillance \nHeightened oversight of surveillance. Surveillance or monitoring systems should be subject to \nheightened oversight that includes at a minimum assessment of potential harms during design (before deploy -\nment) and in an ongoing manner, to ensure that the American public’s rights, opportunities, and access are protected. This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure there is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a specific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the system is in use. \nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of surveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the minimum number of subjects possible. To the greatest extent possible consistent with law enforcement and national security needs, individuals subject to monitoring should be provided with clear and specific notice before it occurs and be informed about how the data gathered through surveillance will be used. \nScope limits on surveillance to protect rights and democratic values. Civil liberties and civil'
 'Risk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten -\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the potential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted communities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of the system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\n-\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention and mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating the safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\n-\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi -\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system. \n18'
 'Data collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \nnarrow identified goals, to avoid ""mission creep.""  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be strictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible. Data collected based on these identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for new privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, which may include express consent. Clear timelines for data retention should be established, with data deleted as soon as possible in accordance with legal or policy-based limitations. Determined data retention timelines should be documented and justi\n-\nfied. \nRisk identification and mitigation. Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should attempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\n-\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks outweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not include sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not reasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \nPrivacy-preserving security. Entities creating, using, or governing automated systems should follow privacy and security best practices designed to ensure data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific consented use case. Best practices could include using privacy-enhancing cryptography or other types of privacy-enhancing technologies or fine-grained permissions and access control mechanisms, along with conventional system security protocols. \n33'
 'SAFE AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEMS \nYou should be protected from unsafe or ineffective sys -\ntems. Automated systems should be developed with consultation \nfrom diverse communities, stakeholders, and domain experts to iden -\ntify concerns, risks, and potential impacts of the system. Systems should undergo pre-deployment testing, risk identification and miti\n-\ngation, and ongoing monitoring that demonstrate they are safe and effective based on their intended use, mitigation of unsafe outcomes including those beyond the intended use, and adherence to do\n-\nmain-specific standards. Outcomes of these protective measures should include the possibility of not deploying the system or remov\n-\ning a system from use. Automated systems should not be designed with an intent or reasonably foreseeable possibility of endangering your safety or the safety of your community. They should be designed to proactively protect you from harms stemming from unintended, yet foreseeable, uses or impacts of automated systems. You should be protected from inappropriate or irrelevant data use in the design, de\n-\nvelopment, and deployment of automated systems, and from the compounded harm of its reuse. Independent evaluation and report\n-\ning that confirms that the system is safe and effective, including re -\nporting of steps taken to mitigate potential harms, should be per -\nformed and the results made public whenever possible. \n15'
 'DATA PRIVACY \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nTraditional terms of service—the block of text that the public is accustomed to clicking through when using a web -\nsite or digital app—are not an adequate mechanism for protecting privacy. The American public should be protect -\ned via built-in privacy protections, data minimization, use and collection limitations, and transparency, in addition \nto being entitled to clear mechanisms to control access to and use of their data—including their metadata—in a proactive, informed, and ongoing way. Any automated system collecting, using, sharing, or storing personal data should meet these expectations. \nProtect privacy by design and by default \nPrivacy by design and by default. Automated systems should be designed and built with privacy protect -\ned by default. Privacy risks should be assessed throughout the development life cycle, including privacy risks from reidentification, and appropriate technical and policy mitigation measures should be implemented. This includes potential harms to those who are not users of the automated system, but who may be harmed by inferred data, purposeful privacy violations, or community surveillance or other community harms. Data collection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected. Data should only be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and use is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected. User experience research should be conducted to confirm that people understand what data is being collected about them and how it will be used, and that this collection matches their expectations and desires.'
 'In discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of these technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the design and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent procedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and receive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the need for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are genuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection of third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. \n57'
 'on people of conscience to act to preserve civil rights—including the right to privacy, which he has called “the \nbasis for so many more rights that we have come to take for granted that are ingrained in the fabric of this \ncountry .”2\nTo advance President Biden’s vision, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has identified \nfive principles that should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American \npublic in the age of artificial intelligence. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a guide for a society that \nprotects all people from these threats—and uses technologies in ways that reinforce our highest values. \nResponding to the experiences of the American public, and informed by insights from researchers, \ntechnologists, advocates, journalists, and policymakers, this framework is accompanied by a technical \ncompanion—a handbook for anyone seeking to incorporate these protections into policy and practice, including \ndetailed steps toward actualizing these principles in the technological design process. These principles help \nprovide guidance whenever automated systems can meaningfully impact the public’s rights, opportunities, \nor access to critical needs. \n3'
 'SAFE AND EFFECTIVE \nSYSTEMS \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nWhile technologies are being deployed to solve problems across a wide array of issues, our reliance on technology can \nalso lead to its use in situations where it has not yet been proven to work—either at all or within an acceptable range of error. In other cases, technologies do not work as intended or as promised, causing substantial and unjustified harm. Automated systems sometimes rely on data from other systems, including historical data, allowing irrelevant informa\n-\ntion from past decisions to infect decision-making in unrelated situations.  In some cases, technologies are purposeful -\nly designed to violate the safety of others, such as technologies designed to facilitate stalking; in other cases, intended or unintended uses lead to unintended harms. \nMany of the harms resulting from these technologies are preventable, and actions are already being taken to protect the public. Some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that key development decisions are vetted by an ethics review; others have identified and mitigated harms found through pre-deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes. Governments at all levels have existing public consulta\n-\ntion processes that may be applied when considering the use of new automated systems, and existing product develop -\nment and testing practices already protect the American public from many potential harms. \nStill, these kinds of practices are deployed too rarely and unevenly. Expanded, proactive protections could build on these existing practices, increase confidence in the use of automated systems, and protect the American public. Inno\n-'
 '-\ndures before deploying the system, as well as responsibility of specific individuals or entities to oversee ongoing assessment and mitigation. Organizational stakeholders including those with oversight of the business process or operation being automated, as well as other organizational divisions that may be affected due to the use of the system, should be involved in establishing governance procedures. Responsibility should rest high enough in the organization that decisions about resources, mitigation, incident response, and potential rollback can be made promptly, with sufficient weight given to risk mitigation objectives against competing concerns. Those holding this responsibility should be made aware of any use cases with the potential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access as determined based on risk identification procedures.  In some cases, it may be appropriate for an independent ethics review to be conducted before deployment. \nAvoid inappropriate, low-quality, or irrelevant data use and the compounded harm of its reuse \nRelevant and high-quality data. Data used as part of any automated system’s creation, evaluation, or \ndeployment should be relevant, of high quality, and tailored to the task at hand. Relevancy should be \nestablished based on research-backed demonstration of the causal influence of the data to the specific use case \nor justified more generally based on a reasonable expectation of usefulness in the domain and/or for the \nsystem design or ongoing development. Relevance of data should not be established solely by appealing to \nits historical connection to the outcome. High quality and tailored data should be representative of the task at \nhand and errors from data entry or other sources should be measured and limited. Any data used as the target \nof a prediction process should receive particular attention to the quality and validity of the predicted outcome'

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Establish specific, narrow goals for the automated system from the outset. This clarity helps ensure that data collection and system functionalities remain focused on the intended purpose, reducing the risk of expanding the system's scope beyond its original intent (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Data Minimization Principles**: Adopt data minimization practices by collecting only the data that is strictly necessary to achieve the defined objectives. This approach not only helps prevent mission creep but also enhances user privacy by limiting the amount of personal information collected (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **User Consent and Control**: Implement mechanisms that allow users to provide informed consent for data collection and usage. Users should have clear options to control what data is collected, how it is used, and the ability to withdraw consent at any time. This empowers users and reinforces their privacy rights (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Regular Audits and Reviews**: Conduct regular audits of the automated system to ensure compliance with the defined objectives and privacy standards. These reviews can help identify any deviations from the original purpose and allow for timely corrective actions (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Limit Data Retention**: Establish clear data retention policies that specify how long data will be kept and when it will be deleted. Data should only be retained as long as necessary for the defined purpose, and unnecessary data should be disposed of promptly to prevent potential misuse (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve stakeholders, including users and privacy advocates, in the design and implementation of the automated system. Their input can help identify potential risks and ensure that the system aligns with user expectations and privacy concerns (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Transparency and Communication**: Maintain transparency about how the automated system operates, what data it collects, and how that data is used. Clear communication helps build trust with users and allows them to make informed decisions about their engagement with the system (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

8. **Ethical Guidelines and Governance**: Establish ethical guidelines and governance structures to oversee the development and deployment of automated systems. This includes setting up review boards or committees that can assess the implications of any changes to the system's scope or data usage (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

By implementing these strategies, organizations can effectively prevent mission creep while ensuring that user privacy and control are prioritized in the design and operation of automated systems.","Automated systems can prevent 'mission creep' and ensure privacy and user control by limiting data collection to specific, narrow goals that are strictly necessary for the identified purposes. Data collection should be minimized, clearly communicated to users, and used only for legal and expected purposes.

1. **Automated Content Analysis**: GAI can assist in analyzing large volumes of content quickly, identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate issues with content origin or authenticity. This capability allows red teams to focus on more complex tasks while GAI handles routine analysis (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Provenance Tracking**: GAI can be integrated with provenance tracking systems to automatically log and verify the origin of content. By generating metadata that includes information about the content's creation, modifications, and sources, GAI can help ensure that all content is traceable and accountable (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Simulating Adversarial Scenarios**: GAI can create realistic scenarios that simulate potential attacks or misuse of content. This allows red teams to test the resilience of content tracking systems and incident response protocols, identifying vulnerabilities that need to be addressed (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Enhanced Incident Reporting**: GAI can streamline the incident disclosure process by automatically generating reports based on predefined criteria. This ensures that incidents are documented consistently and comprehensively, facilitating better communication and response strategies (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Real-Time Monitoring**: GAI can provide real-time monitoring of content generation and dissemination, alerting red teams to potential incidents as they occur. This proactive approach allows for quicker responses to emerging threats and helps maintain the integrity of content (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Feedback Loop Integration**: By incorporating feedback from red-teaming exercises, GAI systems can learn and adapt over time. This continuous improvement process enhances the effectiveness of content tracking and incident disclosure mechanisms, ensuring they remain robust against evolving threats (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Collaboration Tools**: GAI can facilitate collaboration between human red team members by providing tools that enhance communication and information sharing. This can include generating summaries of findings, suggesting next steps, and organizing data in a way that is easily accessible for team members (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

By leveraging GAI technology in these ways, organizations can enhance their red-teaming efforts, ensuring more effective content origin tracking and incident disclosure, ultimately leading to improved security and trustworthiness of AI systems.","GAI technologies can improve red-teaming with human teams by combining GAI with specialist or non-specialist human teams. GAI-led red-teaming can be more cost-effective than human red-teamers alone and may be better suited for eliciting different types of harms.

Why is it important for lenders to inform consumers about decisions made under FCRA in automated systems?,"[""Providing notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the process of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many forms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory systems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access.

1. **Transparency**: Informing consumers about how their credit decisions are made promotes transparency in the lending process. When consumers understand the criteria and data used in automated decision-making, they can better comprehend the outcomes and the factors influencing their creditworthiness (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Consumer Rights**: The FCRA grants consumers specific rights regarding their credit information, including the right to know when adverse actions are taken based on their credit reports. By providing this information, lenders help ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and can exercise them effectively (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Opportunity for Correction**: When consumers are informed about decisions made using automated systems, they have the opportunity to review their credit reports for inaccuracies or errors. This allows them to contest or correct any misinformation that may have negatively impacted their credit decisions (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Building Trust**: Transparency in decision-making processes fosters trust between lenders and consumers. When consumers feel informed and respected, they are more likely to have confidence in the lending institution and its practices (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Mitigating Discrimination**: Informing consumers about the use of automated systems in credit decisions can help identify and mitigate potential biases or discriminatory practices. By being aware of how decisions are made, consumers can advocate for fair treatment and challenge any unfair practices (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Lenders are required to comply with the FCRA and other relevant regulations. Providing consumers with information about automated decision-making processes helps ensure that lenders meet their legal obligations and avoid potential penalties (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

In summary, informing consumers about decisions made under the FCRA in automated systems is essential for promoting transparency, protecting consumer rights, building trust, and ensuring compliance with legal requirements.","It is important for lenders to inform consumers about decisions made under FCRA in automated systems because the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that consumers who are denied credit receive ""adverse action"" notices. These notices must include the reasons for the adverse action taken on the application or an existing credit account. Additionally, under the risk-based pricing rule, lenders must inform borrowers of their credit score or explain when they are receiving worse terms due to information in their credit report. This transparency is crucial to ensure that consumers understand the basis for credit decisions, especially when complex algorithms are involved.",1.0,0.9785683808084092,1.0,0.8734126983981415,0.3438322883515433

 'NOTICE & \nEXPLANATION \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nAutomated systems now determine opportunities, from employment to credit, and directly shape the American \npublic’s experiences, from the courtroom to online classrooms, in ways that profoundly impact people’s lives. But this expansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a hiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\n-\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting decisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. Notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\n-\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. Clear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\n-\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a particular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, unaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement.'

 'HUMAN ALTERNATIVES, \nCONSIDERATION, AND \nFALLBACK \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nThere are many reasons people may prefer not to use an automated system: the system can be flawed and can lead to \nunintended outcomes; it may reinforce bias or be inaccessible; it may simply be inconvenient or unavailable; or it may replace a paper or manual process to which people had grown accustomed. Yet members of the public are often presented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once they decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result of this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, and critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are meaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\n-\nniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or other alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as “reasonable accommodations” for people with disabilities.']","Public transparency is crucial in automated systems that impact individuals' lives and decisions for several reasons:

1. **Accountability**: Transparency ensures that organizations are held accountable for the decisions made by automated systems. When individuals understand how these systems operate and the criteria used for decision-making, it becomes easier to identify and address any potential errors or biases (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Informed Consent**: Individuals have the right to know when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect them. Transparency allows people to provide informed consent regarding their data and how it will be used, fostering trust in the technology (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Understanding and Trust**: When the workings of automated systems are clear, individuals are more likely to trust the outcomes. Transparency helps demystify the technology, making it less intimidating and more acceptable to the public (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Mitigating Bias and Discrimination**: Public transparency can help identify and mitigate biases in automated decision-making. When individuals can scrutinize how decisions are made, it becomes easier to spot unfair practices and advocate for equitable treatment (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Empowerment**: Transparency empowers individuals by providing them with the information they need to understand and challenge decisions that may adversely affect them. This is particularly important in high-stakes areas such as employment, credit, and criminal justice (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Encouraging Ethical Practices**: When organizations know that their automated systems will be subject to public scrutiny, they are more likely to adhere to ethical standards and best practices in their design and implementation (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Facilitating Oversight**: Transparency allows for external oversight by regulators, researchers, and advocacy groups. This oversight is essential for ensuring that automated systems operate fairly and effectively, and it can lead to improvements in technology and policy (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

In summary, public transparency in automated systems is vital for accountability, informed consent, trust, bias mitigation, empowerment, ethical practices, and effective oversight, ultimately leading to better outcomes for individuals and society as a whole.","Public transparency is crucial in automated systems affecting people's lives and decisions because it allows both the authorities and the public to understand why and how decisions are being made. Without transparency, individuals may be subject to decisions made by automated systems without any explanation or accountability, leading to potential errors, biases, and injustices. Transparency also enables experts to verify the reasonableness of recommendations before they are implemented, ensuring safety and efficacy. In summary, public transparency in automated systems is essential for accountability, fairness, and the protection of individuals' rights and opportunities.",1.0,0.9680746218583742,1.0,0.9999999999875,0.6811205603657411
How can governance principles manage risks of GAI effectively?,"['47 Appendix A.  Primary GAI Considerations  \nThe following primary considerations were derived as overarching themes from the GAI PWG \nconsultation process. These considerations (Governance, Pre- Deployment Testing, Content Provenance, \nand Incident Disclosure) are relevant  for volun tary use by any organization designing, developing, and \nusing GAI  and also inform the Actions to Manage GAI risks. Information included about the primary \nconsiderations is not exhaustive , but highlights the most relevant topics derived from the GAI PWG.  \nAcknowledgments: These considerations could not have been surfaced without the helpful analysis and \ncontributions from the community and NIST staﬀ GAI PWG leads: George Awad, Luca Belli, Harold Booth, \nMat Heyman, Yoo young Lee, Mark Pryzbocki, Reva Schwartz, Martin Stanley, and Kyra Yee.  \nA.1. Governance  \nA.1.1.  Overview  \nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks \nrelated to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their \nexisting risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may op t to revis e or update AI system risk levels to address \nthese unique GAI risks. This section describes how organizational governance regimes may be re -\nevaluated and adjusted for GAI contexts. It also addresses third -party considerations for governing across  \nthe AI value chain.  \nA.1.2.  Organizational  Governance  \nGAI opportunities, risks and long- term performance characteristics are typically less well -understood \nthan non- generative AI tools  and may be perceived and acted upon by humans in ways that vary greatly. \nAccordingly, GAI may call for diﬀerent levels of oversight from AI Actors  or diﬀerent human- AI \nconﬁgurations in order to manage their risks eﬀectively. Organizations’ use of GAI systems may also \nwarrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.'

OMB also \npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy,'
 '1 1. Introduction  \nThis document is a cross -sectoral  proﬁle  of and companion resource for  the AI Risk Management \nFramework  (AI RMF  1.0) for Generative AI ,1 pursuant to President Biden’s Executive Order (EO) 14110 on \nSafe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artiﬁcial Intelligence.2 The AI RMF was released in January 2023, and is \nintended for voluntary use and to improve the ability of organizations to incorporate trustworthiness \nconsiderations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems.  \nA proﬁle  is an  implementation of the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories for a speciﬁc \nsetting , application , or technology  – in this case, Generative AI (GAI) – based on the requirements, risk \ntolerance, and resources of the Framework user. AI RMF  proﬁle s assist organizations in deciding how to \nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well -aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \nrequirements and best practices, and reﬂects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \nproﬁles , this proﬁle  oﬀers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \nand for GAI as a technology.  \nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document is an AI RMF cross -sectoral proﬁ le. Cross -sectoral proﬁles can be used to govern, map, measure, and \nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors,  such as the use of \nlarge language models  (LLMs) , cloud -based services, or acquisition.  \nThis document deﬁnes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and describing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \nmap, measure, and manage these risks. \n \n \n1 EO 14110 deﬁnes Generative AI  as “the class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input'

These approaches may also expand coverage \nof the AI risk attack surface.  \n• Human / AI: Performed by GAI in combinatio n with  specialist or non -specialist human teams. \nGAI- led red -teaming can be more cost eﬀective than human red- teamers alone. Human or GAI-\nled AI red -teaming may be better suited for eliciting diﬀerent types of harms.   \nA.1.6.  Content Provenance  \nOverview \nGAI technologies can be leveraged for many applications such as content generation and synthetic data. \nSome aspects of GAI output s, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to \ndistinguish human- generated content from AI -generated synthetic  content. To help manage and mitigate \nthese risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and \nhistory of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater \ninformation access  about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of  \ntrustworthiness  in AI systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, \ndigital content transparency approaches  can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their \nsource, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection mechanisms provide information about the origin \nand history of content  to assist in \nGAI risk management eﬀorts.  \nProvenance metad ata can include information about GAI model developers or creators  of GAI content , \ndate/time of creation, location, modiﬁcations, and sources. Metadata can be tracked for text, images, videos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of p rovenance data tracking techniques  can'
 'We have seen modest progress in recent years, with some state and local governments responding to these prob-\nlems with legislation, and some courts extending longstanding statutory protections to new and emerging tech-nologies. There are companies working to incorporate additional protections in their design and use of auto-mated systems, and researchers developing innovative guardrails. Advocates, researchers, and government organizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems. These include the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) 2019 Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, which includes principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and which the United States adopted, and Executive Order 13960 on Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government, which sets out principles that govern the federal government’s use of AI. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is fully consistent with these principles and with the direction in Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. These principles find kinship in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), derived from the 1973 report of an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Records, Computers, \nand the Rights of Citizens.\n4 While there is no single, universal articulation of the FIPPs, these core \nprinciples for managing information about individuals have been incorporated into data privacy laws and \npolicies across the globe.5 The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights embraces elements of the FIPPs that are \nparticularly relevant to automated systems, without articulating a specific set of FIPPs or scoping \napplicability or the interests served to a single particular domain, like privacy, civil rights and civil liberties,'

Here are several key strategies:

1. **Risk Assessment Frameworks**: Implement comprehensive risk assessment frameworks that identify, evaluate, and prioritize the unique risks associated with GAI. This includes assessing potential biases, misinformation, and security vulnerabilities inherent in GAI systems (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Clear Accountability Structures**: Establish clear lines of accountability within organizations for the development and deployment of GAI systems. This includes designating responsible individuals or teams to oversee GAI projects, ensuring that there is accountability for the outcomes and impacts of these systems (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Transparency and Documentation**: Promote transparency by documenting the decision-making processes, data sources, and algorithms used in GAI systems. This documentation should be accessible to stakeholders, allowing for scrutiny and fostering trust in the technology (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve a diverse range of stakeholders, including affected communities, ethicists, and industry experts, in the governance process. Their input can help identify potential risks and ethical concerns, leading to more robust governance practices (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Ethical Guidelines and Standards**: Develop and adhere to ethical guidelines and standards that govern the use of GAI. These guidelines should address issues such as fairness, accountability, and the prevention of harm, ensuring that GAI systems are used responsibly (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**: Conduct regular audits and monitoring of GAI systems to assess their performance and compliance with established governance principles. This ongoing evaluation helps identify and mitigate risks as they arise (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Training and Awareness Programs**: Implement training programs for employees and stakeholders to raise awareness about the risks associated with GAI and the importance of ethical governance. This education can foster a culture of responsibility and vigilance in the use of GAI technologies (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

8. **Incident Response Protocols**: Establish clear protocols for responding to incidents related to GAI systems, including mechanisms for reporting and addressing issues such as bias, misinformation, or security breaches. This preparedness helps organizations respond effectively to challenges as they arise (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

1. **Mitigating Bias**: Accurate data documentation helps identify and address biases in the training data. If the data is not accurately reviewed, it may contain harmful biases that can lead to discriminatory outcomes in AI systems. By ensuring accuracy, organizations can work to create more equitable AI models that do not perpetuate existing societal biases (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Protecting Intellectual Property**: Accurate documentation of data sources and usage is essential for protecting intellectual property rights. Organizations must ensure that they have the legal right to use the data they are training their AI models on. Inaccurate records can lead to unintentional infringements, resulting in legal disputes and financial liabilities (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Ensuring Information Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy in data documentation is vital for the integrity of the AI system. Inaccurate or poorly documented data can lead to flawed model outputs, which can undermine trust in the system. Ensuring that data is accurate and well-documented helps maintain the reliability of AI-generated information (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Risk Management**: Accurate data documentation is essential for effective risk management in GAI systems. By thoroughly reviewing and documenting data, organizations can better understand the potential risks associated with their AI models, including security vulnerabilities and the likelihood of generating harmful or misleading content. This understanding allows for proactive measures to mitigate these risks (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Compliance with Regulations**: Many jurisdictions have regulations governing data use, privacy, and AI deployment. Accurate documentation helps organizations comply with these regulations, reducing the risk of legal penalties and reputational damage. This is particularly important in the context of GAI, where the potential for misuse of generated content is high (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Facilitating Accountability**: Accurate documentation of data and its usage throughout the AI life cycle enhances accountability. When organizations can trace the origins and transformations of data, they can better justify their decisions and actions, fostering trust among stakeholders and users (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Supporting Continuous Improvement**: Accurate data documentation allows organizations to learn from past experiences and improve their AI systems over time. By understanding what data was used, how it was processed, and the outcomes produced, organizations can refine their models and practices to enhance performance and reduce risks (Source: [document name], p.

1. **Structured Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement structured feedback tools such as surveys, questionnaires, and rating systems that allow users to provide specific input on AI-generated content. These tools can include questions about the relevance, accuracy, and perceived quality of the content, helping to gather quantitative and qualitative data (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Participatory Engagement**: Engage users and affected communities in the development and review process of AI-generated content. This can involve focus groups, workshops, or public forums where users can discuss their experiences and expectations. Such participatory methods ensure that the content aligns with community values and needs (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Utilize real-time monitoring tools to track user interactions with AI-generated content. By analyzing user behavior, such as engagement rates and feedback patterns, organizations can identify shifts in quality and user satisfaction over time (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Feedback Loops**: Establish feedback loops where user input is regularly reviewed and integrated into the AI system's development process. This iterative approach allows organizations to adapt and improve the content based on user experiences and changing community values (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Quality Metrics**: Develop and implement metrics to evaluate the quality of AI-generated content based on user feedback. These metrics can include measures of accuracy, relevance, and alignment with user expectations, helping to identify areas for improvement (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Anonymity and Confidentiality**: Ensure that feedback mechanisms respect user privacy by allowing anonymous submissions. This encourages more honest and open feedback, as users may feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts without fear of repercussions (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Diverse Representation**: Actively seek feedback from a diverse range of users to capture different perspectives and values. This diversity helps ensure that the AI-generated content is inclusive and representative of various community interests (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

8. **Regular Reporting**: Provide regular reports to users about how their feedback has been used to improve AI-generated content. This transparency fosters trust and encourages continued engagement from users, as they see the impact of their input (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

 'WHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nEnsuring accessibility during design, development, and deployment. Systems should be \ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili -\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi -\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth -\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, colo r, ethnicity, sex \n(including pregnanc y, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identit y, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disabilit y, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi -\ncation protected by la w. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea -\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity assessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be instituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every instance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\n-\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a justification for any continued use of the system.'
 'In discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of these technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the design and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent procedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and receive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the need for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are genuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection of third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. \n57'
 ""-\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual results is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how demographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via qualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed more frequentl y. Outcomes of this assessment should include additional disparity mitigation, if needed, or \nfallback to earlier procedures in the case that equity standards are no longer met and can't be mitigated, and prior mechanisms provide better adherence to equity standards. \n27Algorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections""
 ""HUMAN ALTERNATIVES, \nCONSIDERATION, AND \nFALLBACK \nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE\nReal-life examples of how these principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practical \ntechnical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \nHealthcare “navigators” help people find their way through online signup forms to choose \nand obtain healthcare. A Navigator is “an individual or organization that's trained and able to help \nconsumers, small businesses, and their employees as they look for health coverage options through the \nMarketplace (a government web site), including completing eligibility and enrollment forms.”106 For \nthe 2022 plan year, the Biden-Harris Administration increased funding so that grantee organizations could \n“train and certify more than 1,500 Navigators to help uninsured consumers find affordable and comprehensive \nhealth coverage. ”107\nThe customer service industry has successfully integrated automated services such as \nchat-bots and AI-driven call response systems with escalation to a human support team.\n108 Many businesses now use partially automated customer service platforms that help answer customer \nquestions and compile common problems for human agents to review. These integrated human-AI \nsystems allow companies to provide faster customer care while maintaining human agents to answer \ncalls or otherwise respond to complicated requests. Using both AI and human agents is viewed as key to \nsuccessful customer service.109\nBallot curing laws in at least 24 states require a fallback system that allows voters to \ncorrect their ballot and have it counted in the case that a voter signature matching algorithm incorrectly flags their ballot as invalid or there is another issue with their ballot, and review by an election official does not rectify the problem.

 'In addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback system in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is tested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human review against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have to wait—immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a remedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated card access system fails. \nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems are used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors diagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous outcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human oversight in such settings. \nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to provide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still in place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers often retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an airplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a misidentification.']","Measures being taken to address issues for transgender travelers at airport checkpoints include:

Definitions of ‘equity’ and ‘underserved communities’ can be found in the Definitions section of']","Ballot curing laws assist voters in addressing ballot issues by providing mechanisms for voters to correct problems with their ballots, particularly in light of the shortcomings of signature matching systems. Here are some key ways these laws help:

1. **Opportunity for Correction**: Ballot curing laws allow voters to be notified if there are issues with their ballots, such as mismatched signatures. Voters can then take action to correct these issues, ensuring that their votes are counted. This process typically involves providing additional information or a new signature to verify their identity (Source: [document name], p. 110).

2. **Human Oversight**: These laws often require election officials to engage in a human curing process, which allows for a more nuanced review of ballots. This is particularly important because automated signature matching systems can disproportionately affect certain groups of voters, such as those with disabilities or those who have changed their names. Human intervention helps ensure that voters have a fair chance to rectify any discrepancies (Source: [document name], p. 110).

3. **Reducing Disenfranchisement**: By allowing voters to cure their ballots, these laws help reduce the risk of disenfranchisement that can occur due to strict signature matching criteria. Many voters may not be aware of the specific requirements for their signatures, and ballot curing provides a safety net to ensure that their votes are not discarded due to technicalities (Source: [document name], p. 110).

4. **Enhanced Voter Confidence**: Knowing that there is a process in place to address ballot issues can enhance voter confidence in the electoral system. Voters are more likely to participate when they feel assured that their votes will be counted, even if there are minor issues with their ballots (Source: [document name], p. 110).

5. **Standardization of Processes**: Ballot curing laws can help standardize the processes used by election officials across different jurisdictions, leading to more consistent treatment of voters. This can help ensure that all voters have access to the same opportunities for correcting ballot issues, regardless of where they live (Source: [document name], p. 110).

In summary, ballot curing laws play a crucial role in assisting voters by providing mechanisms to address ballot issues, ensuring that their votes are counted, and enhancing overall confidence in the electoral process.","Ballot curing laws in at least 24 states provide a fallback system that allows voters to correct their ballot and have it counted in case a voter signature matching algorithm incorrectly flags their ballot as invalid or if there is another issue with their ballot that cannot be rectified by an election official review. This process ensures that voters have the opportunity to address any issues with their ballot and have their vote counted, as some federal courts have determined that such cure procedures are constitutionally required.",0.9310344827586207,0.9485702744446209,0.6666666666666666,0.8333333332916666,0.9121470946310856

Content Provenance  \nOverview \nGAI technologies can be leveraged for many applications such as content generation and synthetic data. \nSome aspects of GAI output s, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to \ndistinguish human- generated content from AI -generated synthetic  content. To help manage and mitigate \nthese risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and \nhistory of content.

 '50 Participatory Engagement Methods  \nOn an ad hoc or more structured basis, organizations can design and use a variety of channels to engage \nexternal stakeholders in product development or review. Focus groups with select experts can provide \nfeedback on a range of issues. Small user studies c an provide feedback from representative groups or \npopulations. Anonymous surveys can be used to poll or gauge reactions to speciﬁc features. Participatory engagement methods are often less structured than ﬁeld testing or red teaming, and are more \ncommonl y used in early stages of AI or product development.  \nField Testing  \nField testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions \nunder which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user \npreferences and experiences towards AI risks and impacts – both negative and positive. When carried \nout with large groups of users, these tests can provide estimations of the likelihood of risks and impacts \nin real world interactions.  \nOrganizations may also collect feedback on outcomes, harms, and user experience directly from users in the production environment after a model has been released, in accordance with human subject \nstandards such as informed consent and compensation.

AI \nred-teaming can be performed before or after AI models or systems are made available to the broader']","Feedback and red-teaming can be effectively utilized to assess equity in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and ensure transparency in content through several key strategies:

1. **Structured Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement structured feedback systems that allow users and affected communities to provide input on GAI outputs. This can include surveys, focus groups, and public forums where participants can express their experiences and concerns regarding the equity and fairness of the content generated by GAI systems (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Diverse Red-Teaming Teams**: Form diverse red-teaming groups that include individuals from various backgrounds, experiences, and expertise. This diversity helps identify potential biases and inequities in GAI outputs, as team members can bring different perspectives to the evaluation process (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Scenario Testing**: Use red-teaming to simulate various scenarios in which GAI systems might produce biased or inequitable content. By testing the system under different conditions, organizations can uncover vulnerabilities and areas for improvement, ensuring that the GAI outputs are fair and representative (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Transparency in Processes**: Ensure that the processes used for feedback collection and red-teaming are transparent. This includes clearly communicating how feedback will be used, how red-teaming exercises are conducted, and what measures are taken to address identified issues. Transparency fosters trust and encourages more meaningful participation from stakeholders (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Documentation of Findings**: Maintain thorough documentation of the findings from feedback and red-teaming exercises. This documentation should include identified biases, recommendations for improvement, and the steps taken to address equity concerns. This record can serve as a valuable resource for ongoing assessment and accountability (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Iterative Improvement**: Use the insights gained from feedback and red-teaming to inform iterative improvements to GAI systems. By continuously refining the models based on user input and red-team findings, organizations can enhance the equity and transparency of their GAI outputs over time (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Engagement with Affected Communities**: Actively engage with communities that may be impacted by GAI outputs. This engagement can help ensure that the content generated is aligned with the values and needs of those communities, promoting equity and inclusivity in the development process (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

 'Disparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparit y. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \nthe disparity may be required by law. Disparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \nOngoing monitoring and mitigation.

 'Guarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or deployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using a system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be avoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can contribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would lead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated by an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by testing for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system design, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the proxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, organizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely for any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \n26Algorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections']","Preventing algorithmic discrimination through proactive measures and equity assessments involves several key strategies:

1. **Proactive Equity Assessments**: Conduct thorough equity assessments during the design and development phases of automated systems. This includes evaluating the potential impacts of algorithms on different demographic groups to identify and mitigate any biases before deployment (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Diverse and Representative Data**: Ensure that the training data used for algorithms is diverse and representative of the populations affected by the system. This helps to minimize biases that can arise from underrepresented groups and ensures that the algorithm performs equitably across different demographics (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Bias Testing and Mitigation**: Implement regular bias testing to identify any discriminatory outcomes produced by the algorithm. This can involve using statistical methods to analyze the algorithm's outputs and comparing them across different demographic groups. If biases are detected, organizations should take steps to mitigate them, such as adjusting the model or retraining it with more representative data (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Human Oversight**: Incorporate human oversight in the decision-making process, especially in high-stakes situations. Human reviewers can provide context and judgment that algorithms may lack, helping to ensure that decisions are fair and just (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Transparent Algorithms**: Develop algorithms that are transparent and interpretable. This means providing clear explanations of how decisions are made and what factors influence the outcomes. Transparency allows stakeholders to understand the decision-making process and identify potential areas of concern (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with stakeholders, including affected communities, advocacy groups, and experts, to gather input on the design and implementation of algorithms. Their insights can help identify potential biases and ensure that the system aligns with community values and needs (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**: Establish a framework for ongoing audits and monitoring of algorithmic systems to assess their performance and impact over time. This includes tracking outcomes and making adjustments as necessary to address any emerging issues related to discrimination (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

8. **Clear Accountability Structures**: Create clear accountability structures within organizations for addressing algorithmic discrimination. This includes designating responsible individuals or teams to oversee equity assessments and ensure compliance with anti-discrimination policies (Source: [document name], p.

Additionally, automated systems used within \nsensitive domains should meet these expectations: \nNarrowly scoped data and inferences. Human oversight should ensure that automated systems in \nsensitive domains are narrowly scoped to address a defined goal, justifying each included data item or attri -\nbute as relevant to the specific use case. Data included should be carefully limited to avoid algorithmic discrimination resulting from, e.g., use of community characteristics, social network analysis, or group-based inferences. \nTailored to the situation. Human oversight should ensure that automated systems in sensitive domains are tailored to the specific use case and real-world deployment scenario, and evaluation testing should show that the system is safe and effective for that specific situation. Validation testing performed based on one loca\n-\ntion or use case should not be assumed to transfer to another. \nHuman consideration before any high-risk decision. Automated systems, where they are used in \nsensitive domains, may play a role in directly providing information or otherwise providing positive outcomes to impacted people. However, automated systems should not be allowed to directly intervene in high-risk situations, such as sentencing decisions or medical care, without human consideration.'
 'NOTICE & \nEXPLANATION \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nAutomated systems now determine opportunities, from employment to credit, and directly shape the American \npublic’s experiences, from the courtroom to online classrooms, in ways that profoundly impact people’s lives. But this expansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a hiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\n-\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting decisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. Notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\n-\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. Clear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\n-\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a particular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, unaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement.'
 'SAFE AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEMS \nYou should be protected from unsafe or ineffective sys -\ntems. Automated systems should be developed with consultation \nfrom diverse communities, stakeholders, and domain experts to iden -\ntify concerns, risks, and potential impacts of the system.

Outcomes of these protective measures should include the possibility of not deploying the system or remov\n-\ning a system from use. Automated systems should not be designed with an intent or reasonably foreseeable possibility of endangering your safety or the safety of your community. They should be designed to proactively protect you from harms stemming from unintended, yet foreseeable, uses or impacts of automated systems.

1. **Clear Objectives and Use Cases**: Define specific objectives and use cases for the automated system, particularly in high-risk areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, or finance. This clarity helps guide the design process and ensures that the system's behavior aligns with its intended purpose (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

2. **Transparent Algorithms**: Utilize algorithms that are interpretable and transparent. This means selecting models that allow stakeholders to understand how inputs are transformed into outputs. For high-risk settings, it is crucial to avoid ""black box"" models that obscure decision-making processes (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

3. **Explanatory Interfaces**: Develop user-friendly interfaces that present explanations of the system's decisions in an accessible manner. These interfaces should provide insights into the factors influencing decisions, making it easier for users to comprehend the rationale behind outcomes (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

4. **Documentation of Decision-Making Processes**: Maintain comprehensive documentation that outlines the decision-making processes of the automated system. This documentation should detail the data inputs, algorithms used, and the reasoning behind specific outputs, ensuring that stakeholders can trace how decisions are reached (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

5. **Error Range Calculations**: Include error ranges in the explanations provided by the system. This helps users understand the potential variability in outcomes and the confidence level associated with specific decisions, which is particularly important in high-stakes scenarios (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

6. **Human Oversight**: Implement human oversight in the decision-making process, especially in high-risk situations. Human operators should review and validate the explanations provided by the automated system, ensuring that they align with intended purposes and ethical standards (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

7. **Regular Audits and Updates**: Conduct regular audits of the system to ensure that the explanatory mechanisms remain effective and relevant. This includes updating the system based on new findings, user feedback, and changes in the regulatory landscape (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

8. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve relevant stakeholders, including users, legal experts, and ethicists, in the development and implementation of the automated system. Their input can help identify potential risks and ensure that the system operates within ethical and legal boundaries (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number not provided]).

By incorporating these strategies into the system design, organizations can enhance behavior transparency in high-risk settings, ensuring that stakeholders have a clear understanding of how decisions are made and fostering trust in the technology.","In settings where the consequences are high as determined by a risk assessment, or extensive oversight is expected (e.g., in criminal justice or some public sector settings), explanatory mechanisms should be built into the system design so that the system’s full behavior can be explained in advance (i.e., only fully transparent models should be used), rather than as an after-the-decision interpretation.
