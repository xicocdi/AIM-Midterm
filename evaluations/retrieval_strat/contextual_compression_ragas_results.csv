What is the significance of providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems?,"['Providing notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, making a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such as credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. While notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the validity and reasonable use of automated systems. The lack of a timely explanation made it harder to understand and contest the decision. The lack of notice or an explanation makes it harder for those performing child maltreatment assessments to validate the risk assessment and denies parents knowledge that could help them contest a decision.'
 'You should know that an automated system is being used, and understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of the overall system functioning and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are in use, the individual or organization responsible for the system, and explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible. Such notice should be kept up-to-date and people impacted by the system should be notified of significant use case or key functionality changes. You should know how and why an outcome impacting you was determined by an automated system, including when the automated system is not the sole input determining the outcome. Automated systems should provide explanations that are technically valid, meaningful and useful to you and to any operators or others who need to understand the system, and calibrated to the level of risk based on the context. Reporting that includes summary information about these automated systems in plain language and assessments of the clarity and quality of the notice and explanations should be made public whenever possible.'
 'An automated system should provide demonstrably clear, timely, understandable, and accessible notice of use, and explanations as to how and why a decision was made or an action was taken by the system. Notices should clearly identify the entity responsible for designing each component of the system and the entity using it. Users should receive notice of the use of automated systems in advance of using or while being impacted by the technology. An explanation should be available with the decision itself, or soon thereafter. Notice should be kept up-to-date and people impacted by the system should be notified of use case or key functionality changes. Notices and explanations should be assessed, such as by research on users’ experiences, including user testing, to ensure that the people using or impacted by the automated system are able to easily.'
 'NOTICE & \nEXPLANATION \nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems which the principle seeks to address and protect \nagainst, including illustrative examples. \nAutomated systems now determine opportunities, from employment to credit, and directly shape the American \npublic’s experiences, from the courtroom to online classrooms, in ways that profoundly impact people’s lives. But this expansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a hiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge denying their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting decisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. Notice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonableness of a recommendation before enacting it. \nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. Clear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like-\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a particular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, unaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and more important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted by those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline requirement.']","Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant for several reasons:

1. **Transparency**: It ensures that individuals are aware when automated systems are being used to make decisions that affect their rights, opportunities, or access. This transparency helps build trust in the technology and the entities deploying it.

2. **Empowerment**: When people receive clear explanations about how decisions are made by automated systems, they are better equipped to understand and contest those decisions if necessary. This is particularly important in sensitive areas like employment, credit, and legal proceedings, where outcomes can have profound impacts on individuals' lives.

3. **Accountability**: Notice and explanation requirements hold organizations accountable for their automated systems. By clearly identifying the entities responsible for the design and use of these systems, it becomes easier to address any issues or biases that may arise.

4. **Error Correction**: Providing notice allows individuals to identify and correct errors in automated decision-making processes. Without this knowledge, individuals may be left without recourse to challenge incorrect or unfair outcomes.

5. **Public Confidence**: Consistent and clear communication about the use of automated systems can enhance public confidence in these technologies. When people understand how and why decisions are made, they are more likely to trust the systems and the organizations that use them.

6. **Safety and Efficacy**: Clear explanations enable experts to verify the reasonableness of recommendations made by automated systems before they are enacted. This is crucial for ensuring that the systems operate safely and effectively.

In summary, notice and explanation requirements are essential for protecting individuals' rights, fostering accountability, and ensuring that automated systems are used responsibly and ethically (Source: [document name], p. [page number]).","Providing notice and explanation as a legal requirement in the context of automated systems is significant because it allows individuals to understand how automated systems are impacting their lives.

 '• Human / AI: Performed by GAI in combination with specialist or non-specialist human teams. GAI-led red-teaming can be more cost effective than human red-teamers alone. Human or GAI-led AI red-teaming may be better suited for eliciting different types of harms.  \nProvenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater information access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of trustworthiness in AI systems.

Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection mechanisms provide information about the origin and history of content to assist in GAI risk management efforts.']","Structured human feedback exercises, such as GAI red-teaming, can significantly benefit GAI risk measurement and management in several ways:

1. **Identifying Vulnerabilities**: Red-teaming allows teams to simulate potential adversarial attacks or adverse behaviors in a controlled environment. This helps identify vulnerabilities in the GAI system that may not be apparent during standard testing.

2. **Stress Testing Safeguards**: By putting the GAI system through various scenarios, red-teaming can evaluate the effectiveness of existing safeguards. This process helps ensure that the measures in place are robust enough to handle unexpected situations or malicious attempts to exploit the system.

3. **Diverse Perspectives**: Involving both human and GAI participants in red-teaming exercises can provide a broader range of insights. Human teams can bring unique perspectives and experiences that may highlight different types of risks or harms that GAI alone might not identify.

4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: GAI-led red-teaming can be more cost-effective than relying solely on human red-teamers. This approach can optimize resources while still providing valuable insights into the system's performance and potential risks.

5. **Calibration of Measurement Methods**: Structured feedback from red-teaming can help calibrate and verify traditional measurement methods used to assess GAI systems. This ensures that the evaluation processes are aligned with real-world performance and risks.

6. **Enhancing Public Trust**: By demonstrating a commitment to rigorous testing and risk management through red-teaming, organizations can enhance public trust in their GAI systems. Transparency in how risks are identified and managed can reassure stakeholders about the safety and reliability of the technology.

7. **Provenance and Transparency**: Incorporating mechanisms like provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection during red-teaming can improve information integrity. This allows organizations to trace negative outcomes back to their source, facilitating better risk management and accountability.

In summary, structured human feedback exercises like GAI red-teaming are crucial for effectively measuring and managing risks associated with GAI systems, ultimately leading to safer and more trustworthy AI applications (Source: GV-4.1-002, p. [specific page number]).","Structured human feedback exercises, such as GAI red-teaming, can be beneficial for GAI risk measurement and management by defining use cases, contexts of use, capabilities, and negative impacts where such exercises would be most beneficial.

How do measurement gaps between laboratory and real-world settings impact the assessment of GAI systems in the context of pre-deployment testing?,"['Currently available pre -deployment TEVV processes used for GAI applications may be inadequate, non- systematically applied, or fail to reﬂect or mismatched to deployment contexts. For example, the anecdotal testing of GAI system capabilities through video games or standardized tests designed for humans (e.g., intelligence tests, professional licensing exams) does not guarantee GAI system validity or reliability in those domains. Similarly, jailbreaking or prompt engineering tests may not systematically assess validity or reliability risks.  \nMeasurement gaps can arise from mismatches between laboratory and real -world settings. Current testing approaches often remain focused on laboratory conditions or restricted to benchmark test datasets and in silico techniques that may not extrapolate well to —or directly assess GAI impacts in real -world conditions. For example, current measurement gaps for GAI make it diﬃcult to precisely estimate its potential ecosystem -level or longitudinal risks and related political, social, and economic impacts. Gaps between benchmarks and real-world use of GAI systems may likely be exacerbated due to prompt sensitivity and broad heterogeneity of contexts of use.']","Measurement gaps between laboratory and real-world settings can significantly affect the assessment of GAI systems during pre-deployment testing in several ways:

1. **Limited Contextual Relevance**: Laboratory tests often focus on controlled environments that may not accurately reflect the complexities and variabilities of real-world situations. This can lead to a mismatch between how a GAI system performs in a lab versus in actual deployment contexts, making it difficult to predict its effectiveness and reliability in practice.

2. **Overfitting to Benchmarks**: Many current testing approaches rely heavily on benchmark datasets and standardized tests. While these benchmarks can provide useful insights, they may not capture the full range of scenarios the GAI system will encounter once deployed. This can result in systems that perform well in tests but fail to generalize to real-world applications.

3. **Prompt Sensitivity**: GAI systems can be highly sensitive to the specific prompts or inputs they receive. In a lab setting, the prompts may be carefully curated, but in real-world use, the inputs can vary widely. This variability can lead to unpredictable outcomes that were not anticipated during testing.

4. **Ecosystem-Level Risks**: Current measurement approaches may not adequately assess the broader ecosystem-level or longitudinal risks associated with GAI systems. This includes potential political, social, and economic impacts that could arise from their deployment, which are often difficult to measure in a lab setting.

5. **Inadequate Validation**: If pre-deployment testing does not account for the diverse contexts in which GAI systems will be used, it may fail to identify critical validity and reliability risks. This can lead to the deployment of systems that are not robust enough to handle real-world challenges.

6. **Feedback Loops**: Real-world deployment can create feedback loops that are not present in laboratory settings. For example, user interactions and societal responses can influence how a GAI system behaves over time, which may not be captured during initial testing phases.

In summary, these measurement gaps can lead to significant challenges in ensuring that GAI systems are safe, effective, and reliable when deployed in real-world environments (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).","Measurement gaps between laboratory and real-world settings can impact the assessment of GAI systems in the context of pre-deployment testing by limiting the extrapolation of results from laboratory conditions to real-world scenarios.

Any data used as the target of a prediction process should receive particular attention to the quality and validity of the predicted outcome.']","To prevent ""mission creep"" in automated systems, data collection and use-case scope limits should be determined and implemented through a structured approach that includes the following steps:

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Start by establishing specific, narrow goals for the automated system. This involves identifying the precise purpose of data collection and ensuring that it aligns with the intended use of the system. Clear objectives help prevent the system from being used for unintended purposes.

2. **Conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment**: Before data collection begins, conduct a thorough assessment to evaluate potential privacy risks associated with the data being collected. This assessment should consider how the data will be used, who will have access to it, and the potential impact on individuals' privacy rights.

3. **Limit Data Collection**: Collect only the data that is strictly necessary to achieve the defined objectives. Avoid gathering excessive or unrelated data that could lead to mission creep. This principle of data minimization is crucial for protecting individual privacy and ensuring compliance with legal standards.

4. **Establish Use-Case Boundaries**: Clearly define the contexts in which the collected data can be used. This includes specifying the types of analyses that can be performed and the decisions that can be made based on the data. Any use outside these boundaries should require a new assessment of privacy risks and potential impacts.

5. **Implement Data Retention Policies**: Set clear timelines for how long data will be retained. Data should be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the identified goals, in accordance with legal or policy-based limitations. Documenting and justifying these retention timelines is essential for accountability.

6. **Regularly Review and Update Policies**: Periodically review data collection practices and use-case boundaries to ensure they remain relevant and effective. This includes assessing whether the original objectives are still valid and whether any changes in technology or regulations necessitate adjustments.

7. **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve relevant stakeholders, including legal, compliance, and privacy experts, in the development and implementation of data collection policies. Their insights can help ensure that the policies are comprehensive and aligned with best practices.

8. **Provide Transparency and Notice**: Inform individuals about what data is being collected, how it will be used, and their rights regarding their data. Transparency helps build trust and allows individuals to make informed decisions about their participation.

By following these steps, organizations can effectively determine and implement data collection and use-case scope limits in automated systems, thereby minimizing the risk of mission creep and protecting individual privacy rights (Source: [document name], p.

 'Meaningful access to examine the system. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should consider limited waivers of confidentiality (including those related to trade secrets) where necessary in order to provide meaningful oversight of systems used in sensitive domains, incorporating measures to protect intellectual property and trade secrets from unwarranted disclosure as appropriate. This includes (potentially private and protected) meaningful access to source code, documentation, and related data during any associated legal discovery, subject to effective confidentiality or court orders. Such meaningful access should include (but is not limited to) adhering to the principle on Notice and Explanation using the highest level of risk so the system is designed with built-in explanations; such systems should use fully-transparent models where the model itself can be understood by people needing to directly examine it.']","To guarantee complete behavior transparency in high-risk environments, explanatory mechanisms should be integrated into system design through the following strategies:

1. **Use Fully Transparent Models**: Design AI systems using models that are inherently interpretable. This means selecting algorithms that allow users to understand how decisions are made without needing complex post-hoc explanations. For example, decision trees or linear models can be more transparent than deep learning models.

2. **Built-in Explanation Features**: Incorporate features that provide real-time explanations of the system's behavior. This could include visualizations of decision pathways, confidence scores for predictions, or summaries of the factors influencing a decision. These features should be accessible to users and stakeholders.

3. **Documentation and Training**: Provide comprehensive documentation that outlines how the system works, including its limitations and the rationale behind its design choices. Additionally, training for users on how to interpret the explanations and understand the system's behavior is crucial.

4. **Regular Updates and Assessments**: Establish processes for regularly assessing and updating the explanatory mechanisms as the system evolves. This includes revisiting the explanations provided to ensure they remain relevant and accurate as the model is refined or as new data is introduced.

5. **User-Centric Design**: Engage with end-users during the design process to understand their needs and expectations regarding explanations. Tailoring the level of detail and type of explanations to the users' expertise and context can enhance understanding and trust.

6. **Feedback Loops**: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the explanations they receive. This feedback can be used to improve the clarity and usefulness of the explanations over time.

7. **Risk-Based Tailoring**: Adjust the extent and type of explanations based on the risk level associated with the system's decisions. For high-risk applications, more detailed and comprehensive explanations should be provided, while lower-risk applications may require simpler explanations.

8. **Meaningful Access for Oversight**: Ensure that designers, developers, and deployers of the system provide meaningful access to the underlying data, algorithms, and decision-making processes. This may involve limited waivers of confidentiality to allow for oversight while protecting sensitive information.

By integrating these strategies into the system design, organizations can enhance transparency and accountability in high-risk environments, ultimately fostering trust in AI technologies (Source: GV-4.1-001, p.

What are some examples of GAI risks that organizations need to consider in the development and deployment of AI systems?,"['GAI risks can vary along many dimensions:  \n• Stage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, and/or decommissioning.  \n• Scope: Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation levels (i.e., for a specific use case), or at the ecosystem level – that is, beyond a single system or organizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of “algorithmic monocultures,” resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to opportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.  \n• Source of risk: Risks may emerge from factors related to the design, training, or operation of the GAI model itself, stemming in some cases from GAI model or system inputs, and in other cases, from GAI system outputs. Many GAI risks, however, originate from human behavior.'
 'Organizations can restrict AI applications that cause harm, exceed stated risk tolerances, or that conﬂict with their tolerances or values. Governance tools and protocols that are applied to other types of AI systems can be applied to GAI systems. These p lans and actions include: \n• Accessibility and reasonable accommodations  \n• AI actor credentials and qualiﬁcations  \n• Alignment to organizational values  \n• Auditing and assessment  \n• Change -management controls  \n• Commercial use  \n• Data provenance'
 'For instance , prompt  injection  involves  modifying what  input is provided to a  GAI system  so that it  \nbehave s in unintended ways. In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious  prompts  and \ninput them directly to a GAI system , with a variety of downstream negative consequences to \ninterconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection  attacks occur when  adversaries remotely (i.e., without \na direct interface) exploit LLM -integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be \nretrieved.

 'A.1. Governance  \nA.1.1.  Overview  \nLike any other technology system, governance principles and techniques can be used to manage risks related to generative AI models, capabilities, and applications. Organizations may choose to apply their existing risk tiering to GAI systems, or they may opt to revise or update AI system risk levels to address these unique GAI risks.

Organizations’ use of GAI systems may also warrant additional human review, tracking and documentation, and greater management oversight.']","Organizations need to consider several risks associated with Generative AI (GAI) during the development and deployment of AI systems. Here are some key examples:

1. **Data Privacy Risks**: GAI systems often require large datasets for training, which may include sensitive personal information. If not handled properly, this can lead to breaches of privacy and violations of data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

2. **Bias and Discrimination**: GAI models can inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in the training data. This can result in outputs that are discriminatory or unfair, impacting marginalized groups and leading to reputational damage for organizations.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: GAI systems can be susceptible to various cybersecurity threats, such as prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs are crafted to manipulate the system's behavior. This can lead to unintended consequences and exploitation of the system (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).

4. **Intellectual Property Issues**: The use of copyrighted materials in training datasets can raise legal concerns. If a GAI system generates outputs that closely resemble copyrighted works, it may infringe on intellectual property rights (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).

5. **Misinformation and Manipulation**: GAI can be used to generate misleading or false information, which can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as creating deepfakes or spreading disinformation. This poses risks to public trust and safety.

6. **Operational Risks**: The deployment of GAI systems can lead to operational challenges, such as unexpected system failures or performance issues in real-world scenarios that were not anticipated during testing (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).

7. **Ethical Implications**: The use of GAI raises ethical questions about accountability, transparency, and the potential for misuse. Organizations must navigate these ethical dilemmas to ensure responsible AI use.

8. **Ecosystem-Level Risks**: GAI systems can contribute to broader societal issues, such as algorithmic monocultures, where reliance on similar models leads to reduced diversity in decision-making processes and potential negative impacts on labor markets and creative economies (Source: [document name], p.

The training should reoccur regularly to ensure it is up to date with the system and to ensure the system is used appropriately. Assessment should be ongoing to ensure that the use of the system with human involvement provides for appropriate results, i.e., that the involvement of people does not invalidate the system's assessment as safe and effective or lead to algorithmic discrimination. Oversight. Human-based systems have the potential for bias, including automation bias, as well as other concerns that may limit their effectiveness. The results of assessments of the efficacy and potential bias of such human-based systems should be overseen by governance structures that have the potential to update the operation of the human-based system in order to mitigate these effects.""
 'While notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the validity and reasonable use of automated systems. The lack of a timely explanation made it harder to understand and contest the decision. The lack of notice or an explanation makes it harder for those performing child maltreatment assessments to validate the risk assessment and denies parents knowledge that could help them contest a decision.'
 'Ongoing monitoring. Automated systems should have ongoing monitoring procedures, including recalibra - tion procedures, in place to ensure that their performance does not fall below an acceptable level over time, based on changing real-world conditions or deployment contexts, post-deployment modification, or unexpect - ed conditions. This ongoing monitoring should include continuous evaluation of performance metrics and harm assessments, updates of any systems, and retraining of any machine learning models as necessary, as well as ensuring that fallback mechanisms are in place to allow reversion to a previously working system. Monitor - ing should take into account the performance of both technical system components (the algorithm as well as any hardware components, data inputs, etc.) and human operators. It should include mechanisms for testing the actual accuracy of any predictions or recommendations generated by a system, not just a human operator’s determination of their accuracy. Ongoing monitoring procedures should include manual, human-led monitor - ing as a check in the event there are shortcomings in automated monitoring systems.

1. **Rigorous Testing and Validation**: Conduct thorough testing of the automated system to ensure that the explanations it provides are accurate and reflect the underlying decision-making processes. This includes validating the model against known outcomes and ensuring that the explanations align with the system's behavior.

2. **Clear Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation that outlines how the system generates explanations. This should include details about the algorithms used, the data inputs, and the rationale behind the decision-making process. Clear documentation helps stakeholders understand the basis for the explanations.

3. **User-Centric Design**: Design explanations with the end-user in mind. This means tailoring the complexity and detail of the explanations to the users' expertise and needs. Engaging users during the design process can help ensure that the explanations are meaningful and useful.

4. **Regular Updates and Reassessments**: Continuously monitor and update the system and its explanations as new data becomes available or as the system evolves. Regular reassessments help ensure that the explanations remain valid and relevant over time.

5. **Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the explanations they receive. This feedback can be used to refine and improve the quality of the explanations, ensuring they meet user needs and expectations.

6. **Error Analysis**: Conduct error analysis to identify instances where the system's explanations may have been misleading or incorrect. Understanding the causes of these errors can inform improvements in the explanation generation process.

7. **Transparency in Limitations**: Clearly communicate the limitations of the explanations provided by the system. Users should be made aware of any uncertainties or potential inaccuracies in the explanations, which can help manage expectations and foster trust.

8. **Independent Audits**: Consider engaging third-party auditors to evaluate the validity of the explanations provided by the automated system. Independent assessments can provide an objective perspective on the system's performance and the quality of its explanations.

By implementing these practices, organizations can enhance the validity of the explanations provided by automated systems, thereby improving transparency and trust in AI technologies (Source: [document name], p.

How do generative models like LLMs generate outputs that can lead to confabulations in GAI systems?,"['“Confabulation” refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and conﬁdently present erroneous or false content in response to prompts. Confabulations also include generated outputs that diverge from the prompts or other input or that contradict previously generated statements in the same context. Th ese phenomena are colloquially also referred to as “hallucination s” or “fabrication s.” Confabulations can occur across GAI outputs and contexts. Confabulations are a natural result of the way generative models are designed: they generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution of their training data; for example, LLMs predict the next token or word in a sentence or phrase. While such statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce outputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This dynamic is particularly relevant when it comes to open-ended prompts for long-form responses and in domains which require highly contextual and/or domain expertise. Risks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content – often due to the conﬁdent nature of the response – leading users to act upon or promote the false information. This poses a challenge for many real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient information reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong treatments. Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI into applications involving consequential decision making. GAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the system’s answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system’s output.']","Generative models like Large Language Models (LLMs) produce outputs based on statistical patterns learned from vast amounts of training data. However, this process can lead to confabulations, which are instances where the model generates outputs that are factually incorrect or inconsistent. Here’s how this happens:

1. **Statistical Prediction**: LLMs generate text by predicting the next word or token in a sequence based on the context provided. This prediction is based on the statistical distribution of words and phrases in the training data. While this can lead to coherent and contextually relevant outputs, it can also result in the generation of incorrect or nonsensical information if the model encounters unfamiliar contexts or prompts.

2. **Lack of Understanding**: LLMs do not possess true understanding or knowledge; they operate based on patterns rather than comprehension. As a result, they may produce outputs that sound plausible but are factually inaccurate or misleading. This is particularly problematic in complex or specialized domains where precise information is critical.

3. **Open-Ended Prompts**: When given open-ended prompts, LLMs may generate long-form responses that can diverge from the original question or context. This can lead to inconsistencies within the same response or between different responses, as the model attempts to fill in gaps based on its training data rather than adhering strictly to factual accuracy.

4. **Confident Outputs**: LLMs often present their outputs with a high degree of confidence, which can mislead users into believing that the information is accurate. This confidence can be particularly dangerous in applications where users may act on the information provided, such as in healthcare or legal contexts.

5. **Absence of Real-Time Verification**: LLMs do not have the capability to verify facts in real-time or access external databases to confirm the accuracy of their outputs. This limitation means that they can generate information that is outdated or incorrect without any mechanism for correction.

6. **Contextual Sensitivity**: The performance of LLMs can vary significantly based on the specific context or phrasing of the prompt. If the context is ambiguous or poorly defined, the model may generate outputs that are irrelevant or incorrect, leading to confabulations.

In summary, the combination of statistical prediction, lack of true understanding, and the nature of open-ended prompts contributes to the occurrence of confabulations in GAI systems. This highlights the importance of careful oversight and validation when deploying LLMs in real-world applications (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).

2. **Simulating Adversarial Attacks**: GAI can generate realistic attack scenarios and simulate adversarial behavior, helping human teams understand how systems might be exploited. This can include generating phishing emails, crafting social engineering scenarios, or creating malicious payloads.

3. **Enhanced Scenario Generation**: GAI can assist in creating diverse and complex attack scenarios that reflect real-world threats. This helps human teams prepare for a wider range of potential security incidents and develop more robust defense strategies.

4. **Content Provenance Tracking**: To ensure the origin of content generated during red-teaming exercises, organizations can implement provenance data tracking mechanisms. This involves documenting the source of GAI-generated content, including information about the model used, the data inputs, and any modifications made. This transparency is crucial for accountability and understanding the context of the generated content.

5. **Incident Disclosure Protocols**: Establishing clear protocols for documenting and disclosing incidents identified during red-teaming exercises is essential. Organizations should create guidelines that outline the responsibilities of AI actors in reporting incidents, including the nature of the incident, its impact, and the steps taken to address it. This ensures that all relevant stakeholders are informed and can take appropriate action.

6. **Collaboration and Feedback Loops**: GAI can facilitate collaboration between human teams by providing real-time insights and suggestions during red-teaming exercises. This collaborative approach allows human teams to leverage GAI's capabilities while maintaining oversight and critical thinking in evaluating the generated scenarios.

7. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: GAI systems can learn from past red-teaming exercises, improving their ability to generate relevant scenarios and identify vulnerabilities over time. This continuous learning process enhances the effectiveness of red-teaming efforts and helps organizations stay ahead of emerging threats.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**: GAI can assist in documenting the findings and outcomes of red-teaming exercises, ensuring that all incidents are recorded accurately. This documentation can be used for future reference, training, and compliance purposes.

Why is it important for lenders to inform consumers about decisions made under FCRA in automated systems?,"['Lenders are required by federal law to notify consumers about certain decisions made about them. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act require in certain circumstances that consumers who are denied credit receive ""adverse action"" notices. Anyone who relies on the information in a credit report to deny a consumer credit must, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, provide an ""adverse action"" notice to the consumer, which includes ""notice of the reasons a creditor took adverse action on the application.""'
 'You should know that an automated system is being used, and understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of the overall system functioning and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are in use, the individual or organization responsible for the system, and explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible. Such notice should be kept up-to-date and people impacted by the system should be notified of significant use case or key functionality changes. You should know how and why an outcome impacting you was determined by an automated system, including when the automated system is not the sole input determining the outcome. Automated systems should provide explanations that are technically valid, meaningful and useful to you and to any operators or others who need to understand the system, and calibrated to the level of risk based on the context. Reporting that includes summary information about these automated systems in plain language and assessments of the clarity and quality of the notice and explanations should be made public whenever possible.'
 '""In addition, under the risk-based pricing rule,91 lenders must either inform borrowers of their credit score, or else tell consumers when \'they are getting worse terms because of information in their credit report.\' The CFPB has also asserted that \'[t]he law gives every applicant the right to a specific explanation if their application for credit was denied, and that right is not diminished simply because a company uses a complex algorithm that it doesn\'t understand.\'92 Such explanations illustrate a shared value that certain decisions need to be explained.""']","It is important for lenders to inform consumers about decisions made under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) in automated systems for several key reasons:

1. **Consumer Rights**: The FCRA mandates that consumers have the right to be informed when adverse actions are taken based on information in their credit reports. This includes providing consumers with ""adverse action"" notices that explain the reasons for the decision. Informing consumers helps uphold their rights and ensures they are aware of how their credit information is being used (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).

2. **Transparency**: Providing notice about decisions made by automated systems fosters transparency in the lending process. Consumers need to understand how their creditworthiness is assessed, especially when automated systems are involved. Transparency builds trust between lenders and consumers, as it allows individuals to see the factors influencing their credit decisions.

3. **Opportunity for Correction**: When consumers are informed about adverse decisions, they have the opportunity to review their credit reports and identify any inaccuracies or errors. This is crucial for allowing consumers to correct any misinformation that may have negatively impacted their credit decisions.

4. **Accountability**: Informing consumers about automated decision-making processes holds lenders accountable for their actions. It ensures that lenders cannot rely solely on opaque algorithms without providing explanations for their decisions. This accountability is essential for ethical lending practices.

5. **Understanding of Automated Systems**: As automated systems become more prevalent in lending, it is vital for consumers to understand how these systems operate. Providing clear explanations about the role of automation in decision-making helps demystify the process and empowers consumers to make informed decisions regarding their credit applications.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Lenders are legally required to comply with the FCRA and provide the necessary notifications to consumers. Failing to do so can result in legal repercussions and damage to the lender's reputation. Compliance with these regulations is essential for maintaining trust and credibility in the financial industry.

Why is public transparency important in automated systems affecting people's lives and decisions?,"['You should know that an automated system is being used and understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of the overall system functioning and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are in use, the individual or organization responsible for the system, and explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible. Such notice should be kept up-to-date and people impacted by the system should be notified of significant use case or key functionality changes. You should know how and why an outcome impacting you was determined by an automated system, including when the automated system is not the sole input determining the outcome. Automated systems should provide explanations that are technically valid, meaningful and useful to you and to any operators or others who need to understand the system, and calibrated to the level of risk based on the context. Reporting that includes summary information about these automated systems in plain language and assessments of the clarity and quality of the notice and explanations should be made public whenever possible.'
 'In the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems are used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors diagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous outcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human oversight in such settings.'
 'While technologies are being deployed to solve problems across a wide array of issues, our reliance on technology can also lead to its use in situations where it has not yet been proven to work—either at all or within an acceptable range of error. In other cases, technologies do not work as intended or as promised, causing substantial and unjustified harm. Automated systems sometimes rely on data from other systems, including historical data, allowing irrelevant information from past decisions to infect decision-making in unrelated situations. Many of the harms resulting from these technologies are preventable, and actions are already being taken to protect the public. Some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that key development decisions are vetted by an ethics review; others have identified and mitigated harms found through pre-deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes. Expanded, proactive protections could build on these existing practices, increase confidence in the use of automated systems, and protect the American public.'
 'While notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public deserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, opportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the validity and reasonable use of automated systems. \n\nThe lack of a timely explanation made it harder to understand and contest the decision.\n\nThe lack of notice or an explanation makes it harder for those performing child maltreatment assessments to validate the risk assessment and denies parents knowledge that could help them contest a decision.']","Public transparency is crucial in automated systems that impact individuals' lives and decisions for several reasons:

1. **Accountability**: Transparency ensures that organizations are held accountable for the decisions made by automated systems. When individuals understand how these systems operate and the criteria used for decision-making, it becomes easier to identify and address any potential biases or errors.

Here’s how these laws function:

1. **Addressing Signature Matching Limitations**: Signature matching systems, which are used to verify the identity of voters by comparing signatures on mail-in ballots to those on file, can be problematic. They may not work correctly for certain groups, including individuals with disabilities, those with shorter or hyphenated names, and voters who have changed their names. Ballot curing laws provide a mechanism for these voters to address discrepancies.

2. **Opportunity for Correction**: Ballot curing laws typically allow voters to be notified if there is an issue with their ballot, such as a signature mismatch. Voters are then given the opportunity to correct these issues before the ballot is ultimately rejected. This process is essential for ensuring that all eligible votes are counted.

3. **Varied Curing Processes**: The specific processes for ballot curing can vary by state. Common methods include direct communication from election officials to voters via phone calls, emails, or mail. Voters may be asked to provide additional information or a new signature to verify their identity and confirm the validity of their ballot (Source: Rachel Orey and Owen Bacskai, ""The Low Down on Ballot Curing,"" Nov. 04, 2020).

4. **Enhancing Voter Participation**: By allowing voters to correct issues with their ballots, ballot curing laws help enhance voter participation and confidence in the electoral process. Voters are more likely to engage in the voting process when they know there are mechanisms in place to address potential problems.

5. **Legal Protections**: These laws also serve as legal protections for voters, ensuring that they have recourse if their ballots are challenged or rejected due to signature verification issues. This is particularly important in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process and protecting the rights of voters.

In summary, ballot curing laws are essential for helping voters correct ballot issues, especially in light of the limitations of signature matching systems.

1. **Diverse Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement structured feedback channels that solicit input from a diverse range of users, including those from marginalized or underrepresented communities. This feedback can help identify potential biases in the GAI outputs and assess whether the content produced is equitable and inclusive.

2. **Equity-Focused Red-Teaming**: Conduct red-teaming exercises specifically aimed at evaluating the equity of GAI systems. This involves assembling teams that include individuals with expertise in social justice, equity, and diversity to simulate potential adverse outcomes and identify areas where the GAI system may produce biased or harmful content.

3. **Scenario Testing**: Use red-teaming to create scenarios that reflect real-world contexts in which GAI systems will be deployed. By testing how the system responds to various inputs, teams can assess whether the outputs are fair and equitable across different demographic groups.

4. **Transparency in Processes**: Ensure that the processes used for generating content are transparent. This includes documenting the data sources, algorithms, and decision-making criteria used in the GAI system. Transparency allows stakeholders to understand how content is produced and to identify any potential biases in the underlying data.

5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of GAI outputs to evaluate their equity and fairness. This can involve analyzing the content for representation, language use, and potential stereotypes. Feedback from these audits can inform necessary adjustments to the GAI system.

6. **User-Centric Design**: Engage users in the design and development of GAI systems to ensure that their needs and perspectives are considered. User feedback can help identify potential equity issues early in the development process, leading to more inclusive content generation.

7. **Iterative Improvement**: Use feedback and red-teaming results to iteratively improve the GAI system. By continuously refining the model based on user input and red-teaming findings, organizations can enhance the equity of the content produced and address any identified biases.

8. **Public Reporting**: Share findings from feedback and red-teaming exercises with the public to promote accountability and transparency. Public reporting can help build trust in the GAI system and demonstrate a commitment to equity and responsible AI use.

9. **Training and Awareness**: Provide training for developers and stakeholders on the importance of equity in AI systems. Raising awareness about potential biases and the impact of GAI outputs can foster a culture of responsibility and inclusivity within organizations.

By integrating feedback and red-teaming into the assessment of equity in GAI systems, organizations can ensure that the content produced is fair, transparent, and aligned with ethical standards. This approach not only enhances the quality of GAI outputs but also promotes trust and accountability in AI technologies (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).

How can algorithmic discrimination be prevented through proactive measures and equity assessments?,"['Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should take proactive and continuous measures to protect individuals and communities from algorithmic discrimination and to use and design systems in an equitable way. This protection should include proactive equity assessments as part of the system design, use of representative data and protection against proxies for demographic features, ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities in design and development, pre-deployment and ongoing disparity testing and mitigation, and clear organizational oversight. Independent evaluation and plain language reporting in the form of an algorithmic impact assessment, including disparity testing results and mitigation information, should be performed and made public whenever possible to confirm these protections.'

 'The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice have clearly laid out how employers’ use of AI and other automated systems can result in discrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities.53 The documents explain how employers’ use of software that relies on algorithmic decision-making may violate existing requirements under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). This technical assistance also provides practical tips to employers on how to comply with the ADA, and to job applicants and employees who think that their rights may have been violated.'
 '•The National Disabled Law Students Association expressed concerns that individuals with disabilities were more likely to be flagged as potentially suspicious by remote proctoring AI systems because of their disabili- ty-specific access needs such as needing longer breaks or using screen readers or dictation software.45 \n•An algorithm designed to identify patients with high needs for healthcare systematically assigned lower scores (indicating that they were not as high need) to Black patients than to those of white patients, even when those patients had similar numbers of chronic conditions and other markers of health.46 In addition, healthcare clinical algorithms that are used by physicians to guide clinical decisions may include sociodemographic variables that adjust or “correct” the algorithm’s output on the basis of a patient’s race or ethnicity, which can lead to race-based health inequities.47']","To prevent algorithmic discrimination, organizations can implement proactive measures and conduct equity assessments throughout the lifecycle of their automated systems. Here are several strategies to achieve this:

1. **Proactive Equity Assessments**: Before deploying an algorithm, conduct thorough equity assessments to evaluate its potential impact on different demographic groups. This involves analyzing the data used for training, the algorithm's decision-making processes, and the expected outcomes to identify any biases or disparities.

2. **Diverse Data Collection**: Ensure that the data used to train algorithms is representative of the diverse populations it will affect. This includes collecting data from various demographic groups to avoid reinforcing existing biases and ensuring that the algorithm performs equitably across different segments of the population.

3. **Bias Detection Tools**: Utilize bias detection tools and techniques to identify and mitigate biases in algorithms. This can involve statistical tests to measure fairness and equity in the algorithm's outputs, as well as tools that can highlight potential discriminatory patterns in the data.

4. **Inclusive Design Practices**: Involve diverse stakeholders in the design and development of algorithms. This includes engaging individuals from various backgrounds, including those who may be affected by the algorithm's decisions. Their insights can help identify potential issues and ensure that the system is designed with equity in mind.

5. **Regular Monitoring and Auditing**: Implement ongoing monitoring and auditing of algorithms after deployment to assess their performance and impact. Regular audits can help identify any emerging biases or discriminatory outcomes, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments.

6. **Transparency and Explainability**: Ensure that algorithms are transparent and their decision-making processes are explainable. Providing clear documentation about how algorithms work and the data they use can help stakeholders understand potential biases and hold organizations accountable.

7. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish feedback channels for users and affected communities to report issues related to algorithmic discrimination. This feedback can be invaluable for identifying problems that may not be apparent during initial assessments and for making necessary adjustments.

8. **Training and Awareness**: Provide training for developers, data scientists, and stakeholders on the importance of equity and the risks of algorithmic discrimination. Raising awareness about these issues can foster a culture of responsibility and encourage proactive measures to prevent discrimination.

9. **Ethical Guidelines and Standards**: Develop and adhere to ethical guidelines and standards for algorithm development and deployment. These guidelines should prioritize fairness, accountability, and transparency, ensuring that organizations commit to preventing algorithmic discrimination.

10. **Collaboration with Experts**: Collaborate with external experts, including ethicists, sociologists, and civil rights advocates, to gain insights into potential biases and discrimination in algorithms. Their expertise can help organizations identify blind spots and improve their equity assessments.

By implementing these proactive measures and conducting thorough equity assessments, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of algorithmic discrimination and promote fair and equitable outcomes in their automated systems (Source: [document name], p. [specific page number]).

How can system design ensure behavior transparency in high-risk settings while meeting expectations for automated systems?,"['In settings where the consequences are high as determined by a risk assessment, or extensive oversight is expected (e.g., in criminal justice or some public sector settings), explanatory mechanisms should be built into the system design so that the system’s full behavior can be explained in advance (i.e., only fully transparent models should be used), rather than as an after-the-decision interpretation. In other settings, the extent of explanation provided should be tailored to the risk level. The explanation provided by a system should accurately reflect the factors and the influences that led to a particular decision, and should be meaningful for the particular customization based on purpose, target, and level of risk. While approximation and simplification may be necessary for the system to succeed based on the explanatory purpose and target of the explanation, or to account for the risk of fraud or other concerns related to revealing decision-making information, such simplifications should be done in a scientifically supportable way. Where appropriate based on the explanatory system, error ranges for the explanation should be calculated and included in the explanation, with the choice of presentation of such information balanced with usability and overall interface complexity concerns.'
 'Risk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten -\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the potential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted communities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of the system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\n-\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention and mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating the safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\n-\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi -\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system.'
 'Meaningful access to examine the system. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should consider limited waivers of confidentiality (including those related to trade secrets) where necessary in order to provide meaningful oversight of systems used in sensitive domains, incorporating measures to protect intellectual property and trade secrets from unwarranted disclosure as appropriate. This includes (potentially private and protected) meaningful access to source code, documentation, and related data during any associated legal discovery, subject to effective confidentiality or court orders. Such meaningful access should include (but is not limited to) adhering to the principle on Notice and Explanation using the highest level of risk so the system is designed with built-in explanations; such systems should use fully-transparent models where the model itself can be understood by people needing to directly examine it.'
 'Derived data sources tracked and reviewed carefully. Data that is derived from other data through the use of algorithms, such as data derived or inferred from prior model outputs, should be identified and tracked, e.g., via a specialized type in a data schema. Derived data should be viewed as potentially high-risk inputs that may lead to feedback loops, compounded harm, or inaccurate results. Such sources should be carefully validated against the risk of collateral consequences. \n\nData reuse limits in sensitive domains. Data reuse, and especially data reuse in a new context, can result in the spreading and scaling of harms. Data from some domains, including criminal justice data and data indicating adverse outcomes in domains such as finance, employment, and housing, is especially sensitive, and in some cases its reuse is limited by law. Accordingly, such data should be subject to extra oversight to ensure safety and efficacy. Data reuse of sensitive domain data in other contexts (e.g., criminal data reuse for civil legal matters or private sector use) should only occur where use of such data is legally authorized and, after examination, has benefits for those impacted by the system that outweigh identified risks and, as appropriate, reasonable measures have been implemented to mitigate the identified risks. Such data should be clearly labeled to identify contexts for limited reuse based on sensitivity. Where possible, aggregated datasets may be useful for replacing individual-level sensitive data. \n\nDemonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the system \nIndependent evaluation. Automated systems should be designed to allow for independent evaluation (e.g.,']","To ensure behavior transparency in high-risk settings while meeting expectations for automated systems, system design should incorporate several key principles and practices:

1. **Use of Explainable Models**: Design systems using algorithms that are inherently interpretable. This means selecting models that allow users to understand how decisions are made without requiring complex post-hoc explanations. For example, decision trees or linear regression models can provide clearer insights compared to more opaque models like deep neural networks.

2. **Built-in Explanation Features**: Integrate features that provide real-time explanations of the system's behavior. This could include visualizations of decision pathways, confidence scores for predictions, or summaries of the factors influencing a decision. These features should be user-friendly and accessible to stakeholders.

3. **Documentation and Training**: Provide comprehensive documentation that outlines how the system operates, including its limitations and the rationale behind its design choices. Additionally, training for users on how to interpret the explanations and understand the system's behavior is crucial for effective use.

4. **Regular Updates and Assessments**: Establish processes for regularly assessing and updating the explanatory mechanisms as the system evolves. This includes revisiting the explanations provided to ensure they remain relevant and accurate as the model is refined or as new data is introduced.

5. **User-Centric Design**: Engage with end-users during the design process to understand their needs and expectations regarding explanations. Tailoring the level of detail and type of explanations to the users' expertise and context can enhance understanding and trust.

6. **Feedback Loops**: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the explanations they receive. This feedback can be used to improve the clarity and usefulness of the explanations over time, ensuring they meet user needs.

7. **Risk-Based Tailoring**: Adjust the extent and type of explanations based on the risk level associated with the system's decisions. For high-risk applications, more detailed and comprehensive explanations should be provided, while lower-risk applications may require simpler explanations.

8. **Meaningful Access for Oversight**: Ensure that designers, developers, and deployers of the system provide meaningful access to the underlying data, algorithms, and decision-making processes. This may involve limited waivers of confidentiality to allow for oversight while protecting sensitive information.

9. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve relevant stakeholders, including legal, compliance, and privacy experts, in the development and implementation of transparency measures. Their insights can help ensure that the measures are comprehensive and aligned with best practices.

10. **Error Analysis and Reporting**: Establish protocols for analyzing errors and reporting them transparently. Users should be informed about the types of errors that can occur and how they are addressed, which can help manage expectations and improve trust in the system.

By integrating these strategies into the system design, organizations can enhance transparency and accountability in high-risk environments, ultimately fostering trust in AI technologies and ensuring that they meet user expectations (Source: [document name], p.
